    "# Hospital Readmissions Data Analysis and Recommendations for Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "In October 2012, the US government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will:\n",
    "+ critique a preliminary analysis of readmissions data and recommendations (provided below) for reducing the readmissions rate\n",
    "+ construct a statistically sound analysis and make recommendations of your own \n",
    "\n",

The clustering of many points in those regions make these statements difficult to approve.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Statistical significance depends upon the sample size, practical significance depends upon external factors like cost, time, objective, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea of statistical significance is the unlikelihood that the statistical value measured/observed would occur due to sampling. Usually, a hypothesis test only provides that there \"is\" or \"isn't\" a relationship aside from sampling. It does not describe the \"strength\" of the significance, even though it can prove the existence of the relationship. E.g. For all the hospitals, every 100 discharge increase of the capacity , there is only about 0.3% decrease on the readmission excess. Since the relationship between discharge and readamission can be very weak that there is no practical use to address it. So it may not be very meaningful to act upon that there is a statistical significance that the two are correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding an \"effective size\" measurement , like in this case, the Pearson r, would tell us \"how strong\" the relationship is. The Pearson R can be classified as: R~0.1, the correlation is low; R ~ 0.3, the correlation is medium; R> 0.5, the correlation is large. This combined with statistical significance, can be one example of practical significance. The practical significance is usually addressed depending on the field of study. How \"strong\" is strong can also be different based upon the field and the specific question. In this survey of readmissison on hospitals. I would probably convey to the client that there is a very weak correlation between hospital capacity and readimission. But that relationship may not be strong enough to draw any conclusion to act upon."
