Conduct sensitivity analysis for the interest rate change on deposit balance by applying Sensitivity Indices approach in python as stated below:
Calculate sensitivity indices such as first-order, second-order, and total-order indices using methods like Sobol' indices.
These indices quantify the relative importance of interest rate changes compared to other factors influencing deposit balances.
Implementations of sensitivity indices calculations can be found in packages like SALib (Sensitivity Analysis Library) in Python.

To conduct sensitivity analysis for the impact of interest rate changes on deposit balances using sensitivity indices like Sobol' indices, you can use the SALib (Sensitivity Analysis Library) package in Python. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install SALib**: If you haven't already installed SALib, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install SALib
```

2. **Define Model Function**: Define a function that represents the model you want to analyze. This function should take input parameters (including the interest rate) and output the corresponding deposit balance.

3. **Define Parameter Ranges**: Define the ranges of values for each input parameter, including the interest rate.

4. **Perform Sensitivity Analysis**: Use SALib to perform sensitivity analysis and calculate sensitivity indices such as first-order, second-order, and total-order indices.

5. **Interpret Results**: Analyze the sensitivity indices to understand the relative importance of interest rate changes compared to other factors influencing deposit balances.

Here's a basic example of how you can perform sensitivity analysis using SALib:

```python
from SALib.sample import saltelli
from SALib.analyze import sobol
from SALib.test_functions import Ishigami

# Define the model function
def model_function(x):
    # Example model function (replace with your own)
    # x[0] represents the interest rate
    interest_rate = x[0]
    # Calculate deposit balance (replace with your own calculation)
    deposit_balance = 1000 * (1 + interest_rate)
    return deposit_balance

# Define parameter ranges (assuming interest rate varies from -0.05 to 0.05)
parameter_ranges = {
    'num_vars': 1,
    'names': ['Interest Rate'],
    'bounds': [[-0.05, 0.05]]
}

# Generate samples using Sobol' sequence
param_values = saltelli.sample(parameter_ranges, 1000)

# Evaluate the model at each sample point
model_outputs = [model_function(x) for x in param_values]

# Perform sensitivity analysis using Sobol' indices
sobol_indices = sobol.analyze(parameter_ranges, np.array(model_outputs))

# Print sensitivity indices
print("First-order indices:", sobol_indices['S1'])
print("Second-order indices:", sobol_indices['S2'])
print("Total-order indices:", sobol_indices['ST'])
```

In this example:
- We define a simple model function (`model_function`) that calculates deposit balance based on the interest rate.
- We define the parameter ranges for sensitivity analysis, including the range of values for the interest rate.
- We generate samples using the Sobol' sequence method provided by SALib.
- We evaluate the model at each sample point to obtain model outputs.
- We use SALib to perform sensitivity analysis and calculate Sobol' indices, including first-order, second-order, and total-order indices.
- Finally, we print the sensitivity indices to analyze the relative importance of the interest rate compared to other factors influencing deposit balances.
