**Dear Clients,**

We understand that you need a solution to process and classify various fields from different file formats in a production system, including formats such as ACH, wire transfers, and RTP. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can use our model to address this need effectively:

### Step 1: File Format Identification
First, it’s important to identify the type of file format you are working with. Each file format has specific fields and structures. Our system is designed to recognize and process multiple file formats.

### Step 2: Create a Dictionary of Expected Fields
Our model uses a predefined dictionary of expected fields for each file format. This dictionary includes all the fields we know from different systems and processes.

### Step 3: Use the Side File
For proper classification, a side file is necessary. This side file contains metadata and mappings for the fields. Ensure that your side file is updated and correctly formatted.

### Step 4: Field Classification
Our model employs a classifier to match and classify the fields in your files. It’s akin to the Cypher 100 for images, which can classify various fields based on our predefined dictionary.

### Step 5: Field Translation and Scripting
In some cases, fields may need to be translated or converted. Our model can handle such translations with appropriate scripting, ensuring the fields match the expected formats and types.

### Step 6: Binary and Text Conversion
If your files are in binary format, they need to be converted to text or other readable formats. The model can convert files to comma-separated values or other text formats as required.

### Step 7: Object Detection
Our advanced classifier can process the files not only by field detection but also by object detection within the documents. This is particularly useful for identifying objects in images or aligned text in graphics.

### Step 8: Field Type Identification
Once the fields are detected, the model can classify them into specific types, such as Field Type A, Field Type B, and so on. This classification helps in organizing and processing the data efficiently.

### Example Workflow
1. **Upload the file**: Start by uploading the file to the system.
2. **Select file type**: Choose the correct file type from the list.
3. **Run the classifier**: Use the classifier to process the file and detect fields.
4. **Review results**: Check the classified fields and ensure they match your expectations.
5. **Export data**: Export the classified data in the required format.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can effectively use our model to match and classify specific fields from various file types. Should you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to our support team.
