 1. Business Value of PME/PRT Rules Report:
- As part of the OCC’s audit and review of operations in 2022, it was observed that while PNC’s rules management platforms (PME and PRT) are relatively mature, the volume of rules and associated monitoring has increased significantly. This highlights the importance of maintaining effective monitoring processes to ensure operational compliance and hygiene. The report emphasizes improving the usage of these platforms to streamline operations, reduce redundancy, and comply with regulatory expectations outlined by the OCC in 2022.
  
- The automation project aims to identify and address obsolete or redundant rules, enhancing efficiency and system organization. This allows the business and technology teams to assess rules that are no longer in use and remove them to optimize resources and maintain relevance.

- This initiative supports the continued refinement and understanding of the PME and PRT platforms, focusing on enhancing relatively new and evolving systems.

 2. Purpose of Current Functions:
- The automation efforts primarily target reducing manual tasks, such as generating pivot tables and linking data to other reports, saving time for teams and minimizing errors.
  
- By consolidating all necessary data into a centralized repository, the process reduces redundancy and enhances workflow efficiency across teams, fostering greater accuracy and productivity.

 3. Expected Benefits of Automation:
- Time Savings: The automation offers significant time savings for teams, enabling a shift in focus from data preparation to analysis and strategic reporting.
  
- Centralized Data Management: The centralized storage of data eliminates the need for repeated spreadsheet creation and manual processes, promoting seamless access to critical information.
  
- Streamlined Information Access: Enhanced readiness for potential audits and simplified presentation of information to upper management reduce delays and improve decision-making capabilities.

 4. Regulatory Implications:
- No new regulatory body notifications are required for this automation.
  
- The automation facilitates the ability to address potential inquiries from regulatory bodies, such as OCC, regarding previous observations. By centralizing and automating rules and reports, it becomes easier to retrieve and share relevant data as needed.

 5. Automated PME and PRT Platforms:
The PME and PRT Rules Automation Reports and Tables include the following features:
- PME/PRT Aggregated Data: Covers data from 2021 to the most recent month, including rule execution counts by month and year.
  
- PME/PRT Full Rule Analysis: A comprehensive view of all rules (active and historical) with statistical insights.
  
- PME/PRT Pivot Component: Provides flexible options for data segmentation and reporting, such as filtering by date ranges and generating customized reports.
