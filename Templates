Subject: Welcome to the Model Showdown Competition Team!

Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am thrilled to be your coach for the Model Showdown competition at our company. This journey promises to be both challenging and rewarding, and I am confident that together we will achieve great success.

To facilitate our collaboration, I have prepared a Confluence page that will serve as our central hub for resources and communication. Here is what you can find in the resources directory:

1. **PDF Books**: Two comprehensive books on imbalanced and ensemble modeling. These will provide you with valuable insights and techniques to enhance our models.
2. **Gliffy Diagram Examples**: A couple of examples demonstrating how to present end-to-end model solutions using Gliffy Diagrams. These will help us visualize our processes and results effectively.
3. **Meeting Activity Tracking**: An Excel document to communicate and document our meeting discussion topics. Keeping track of our progress and action items will be crucial for our success.
4. **Orientation Pitch Template Deck**: A template for our model presentation. This will guide us in preparing a compelling and professional presentation for the competition.

We will have our first meeting on Friday, where we can get to know each other, discuss our initial ideas, and outline our strategy. I am excited to hear your thoughts and to begin this journey with you.

Please take some time to explore the resources on the Confluence page before our meeting. If you have any questions or need any assistance, feel free to reach out to me.

Looking forward to our first meeting and the incredible work we will accomplish together.

Best regards,
