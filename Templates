Target Variable Distribution: No measures are taken to control the distribution of claim id and service line grouping in both the training and test sets, leading to inconsistencies.	Target Variable Distribution: Claim id and associated service lines are grouped, with the target variable stratified and sampled in both the training and test sets to maintain consistent distribution.
Feature Engineering: Both Subscriber and Patient age and gender features are utilized without alignment with business requirements.	Feature Engineering: Subscriber/Patient age and gender features are used, along with actual person features during the hospital visit. Age over 89 is flagged as 199 per business requirements.
Hyperparameter Tuning: No hyperparameter optimization is included in the training pipeline, with parameters hard-coded into the codebase.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Integrated hyperparameter optimization is employed in the training pipeline to determine the best parameters for each clientâ€™s data.
Model Interpretability: Feature importance plots are the only tools available, which limits interpretability to a single model aspect.	Model Interpretability: Both global and local SHAP model interpretations are integrated, enhancing interpretability at both the feature importance level and for individual predictions.
Performance Metrics: The evaluation threshold for model performance metrics is set at approximately 0.16, which may have skewed the prediction accuracy.	Performance Metrics: The evaluation threshold is set to a default of 0.50, with plans to apply precision-recall optimization if appropriate.
Data Sampling: Advanced data sampling techniques were not applied.	Data Sampling: State-of-the-art data sampling algorithms are planned for implementation.
External Data Integration: The model pipeline integrates constant HCPCS and MUE files, which may not enhance predictive performance.	External Data Integration: The new model pipeline excludes HCPCS and MUE file integration.
Feature Selection: Not all relevant features are included, with some significant ones missing.	Feature Selection: Sessions with Jerry and Pamela contribute to the creation of new datasets and the development of a robust preprocessing pipeline.
Documentation: Structured documentation is lacking, hindering effective monitoring of model development progress.	Documentation: Both Confluence and the codebase are thoroughly documented to ensure effective monitoring and tracking of the model development process.
