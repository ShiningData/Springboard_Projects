### ARIMA Model Calculations for Forecasting

The AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model combines three basic methods: Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), and Integrated (I) components. The AR part exploits the relationship between an observation and its preceding observations, the MA component models the relationship between an observation and the residual errors from prior observations, and the 'I' component makes the time series stationary by differencing the data points. These three elements are tuned through hyperparameters (p, d, q) to predict future points in the time series.

### Official Summary for Universal Forecasting Model

The purpose of the Multi-Algorithm Robust and Modular Generalized (MRMG) Universal Forecasting Model is to deliver high-accuracy and reliable forecasts by integrating a diverse set of state-of-the-art algorithms including Autogluon, XGBoost, ARIMA, Neural Prophet, and Facebook Prophet. Specially designed for financial institutions, this model is pivotal for forecasting cash flows and card transaction volumes, empowering banks to make data-driven decisions for optimizing liquidity management and operational efficiency. With its robust and versatile architecture, the MRMG model serves as a comprehensive solution for addressing the dynamic and complex nature of financial forecasting challenges.
