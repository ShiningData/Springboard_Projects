Data Workflow Personas
 Notes created on March 17, 2025 at 10:32 AM by Minutes AI
 Workshop Introduction
 • The workshop aims to understand data workflows within Tim's team and related teams.
 • The goal is to build "Personas" or roles that describe data-related activities.
 Background
 • Scott and the DSI team discussed how to ensure Liquidity can manage its data sources 
(around 100 reports).
 • The aim is to create a pipeline to handle 5x growth robustly.
 • The DSI team (Data Science Innovation team led by Bedell) is exploring ways to create a 
data pipeline, prioritize data sources, and understand workflows.
 • The end goal is an application data warehouse for data-driven work, automating report 
creation, and decision support.
 • The focus is on integrating data from various sources into one place to reduce time 
spent searching for data.
 Whiteboard Instructions
 • Use Pan mode to navigate the whiteboard.
 • Avoid moving elements around.
 • Zoom in/out using mouse scroll or trackpad pinch.
 • Middle-click with the mouse to pan.
 Team Overviews
 • Tim's team is responsible for non-interest-bearing products (DACA, sub-accounting), 
international products, P times V balances, and rates.
 
• Jared's team supports the DACA product, including onboarding, implementation, midlife, 
and the "death of the product" or deals within the product, focusing on admin and 
operational aspects.
 Personas
 • Personas are archetypical user roles.
 • Some personas were created during a workshop with Rocio's team for interest-bearing 
and sweep products.
 • The vision is that the work done now will lead to an application data warehouse.
 Data Access Patterns
 • Data access will likely be very broad to all data in the platform.
 • The goal is to figure out data access patterns to inform warehouse construction, data 
storage, and front-end interactions.
 • This is an early-stage effort to understand what's right and wrong.
 Personas Overview
 • **Admin Persona:** Has access to everything and can modify app settings without tech 
team intervention.
 • **Group Product Manager:** Reserved for someone like Scott.
 • **Team Manager, Product Manager, Operations Manager:**
 • Team Manager: Jared
 • Product Managers: Alicia, Dom
 • Product Owner: Jody
 Data Sources
 • Jared answered a question about data sources, directing listeners to a summarized view 
on the right of the whiteboard and a detailed Excel file.
 
• Brandon will forward the Excel file from SharePoint (Current Projects > Liquidity).
 • Data sources cover six broad categories:
 • Market rates and intel (Fed, CME, Bloomberg, internal emails/SharePoint).
 • Internal rates (rate sheets on SharePoints, intranet rate sheet).
 • Ad hoc downloadable reports (TAP, XNET, Systemware, Tableau, Seismic, rate 
management tool).
 • Tableau dashboards.
 • Email reports (duplicated across sections).
 • Data sources for the monthly liquidity meeting and deck.
 Whiteboard Interaction
 • Participants should hover over a Persona post-it and click the yellow thumbs up if the 
role applies to them.
 • This will create a list of applicable tags for each person.
 • Participants can add people who are not present today.
 Personas
 • One role was separated for Scott, but the speaker was being sarcastic.
 • The speaker wanted to explain why that role was separated out for the sake of 
transparency.
 • One person can have multiple Personas.
 Data Management
 • Jared says that team manager, ops manager, and analyst will cover 90% of data 
management.
 • It is assumed that each manager role has its own team underneath it.
 • The dashboards will go by role, not by individual group.
 Data Access
 
• Data access is not going to be hidden.
 • Everyone should have access to the data.
 • If an analyst has access to certain things that a product manager does not, the product 
manager can stack them on and then they have access to both.
 Drilling into Specific Products
 • The speaker wants the ability to drill in on specific products based on the Personas.
 • The speaker only cares about dacas.
 • The speaker suggests daca-specific variants.
 Operations Specialist
 • Hannah mentioned operations specialist under operations manager.
 • It is unclear if operations specialist is distinct from analyst.
 • The speaker is struggling with differentiating between data analytics and analysis 
compared to workflow management.
 Data Collection
 • The speaker was thinking of this from a data collection standpoint.
 • The speaker was wondering where they are wanting to pull data and collect data for 
different roles within an area.
 • The speaker was not sure if they want those kind of team or roles that they would be 
collecting data from for the ops manager.
 Next Steps
 • The speaker wants to spend time talking through how each of the Personas interface 
with data from two angles: how they do it now versus how they would like to do it in an 
ideal world.
 • The speaker gave an example of an analyst perspective: currently, they may have to 
build some reports by hand by pulling from various data sources, but in an ideal world, it 
might be something that's augmented via some sort of automatic process.
 
• They will start with the team manager role.
 User Activity
 • Tim says that based on the data, they are looking at rate information, specific customer 
demographics, and overall P times V.
 Tim's Data Needs
 • Wants a dashboard upon arrival providing industry rates, large movers (big balance 
swings), and financial forecasts (P x V, balances, etc.).
 • A fourth quadrant could be a risk view or project-related view, showing project status 
(green, yellow, red) impacting products, focusing on on-time and on-budget status.
 Jared's Data Needs
 • Prefers a dashboard to identify and drill down into specific areas.
 • Focuses on activity volumes, KPI measurements, and comparing activity volumes to FTE 
needs estimates.
 • Needs a warning system for discrepancies between systems (e.g., DACA coding 
mismatches between Edge Core, System of Record, PME, and Flex Cube).
 Clarification on "Things Not Lining Up"
 • Jared clarifies that his concern is about day-to-day operational mismatches, such as 
incorrect DACA coding, unlike Tim's focus on budget forecasts.
 Alicia's Data Needs
 • Prefers a dashboard with the ability to click into the data.
 • Wants to see the same high-level data as Tim for her products, with the ability to dive 
deeper into unexpected variances.
 • Wants a single place to access all data, currently uses disparate sources.
 
Unexpected Variance Examples
 • Examples include large balance swings or unexpected P times V figures.
 • Key categories are balances, rates, and fees, with subcategories within each.
 Variance Thresholds
 • A variance of 10% plus or minus could be a good starting point for identifying 
unexpected changes.
 Dashboard and Data Access
 • Dashboard should have the ability to access source data and view unexpected 
variances.
 • Add the ability to access data sources from the group's overall data source list 
(compiled by Emily), possibly via a sidebar with direct links.
 Product Manager Needs (Alicia)
 • Alicia wants to know where a customer is in the onboarding process, especially for 
bigger customers.
 • Alicia wants the data scientists to determine which data points are important.
 Dominic's Requirements: International (Canada Branch)
 • **Canada Branch:**
 • CED (Capital Equivalent Deposits) monitoring (mandatory reporting).
 • Canada branch deposits, including RBC legacy deposits.
 • Top 5 deposits, withdrawals, and balances.
 • Wishlist: Real-time balances for Canada branch (currently not possible).
 • Links to daily Excel reports.
 • Industry rates: Fed Funds, Bank of Canada, Bank of England, etc.
 
• Wishlist: Competitive intel on the "big five" Canadian banks' rates posted online.
 Dominic's Requirements: International (MCA Foreign 
Currency Caps)
 • MCA Foreign Currency Caps:
 • Top 5 currencies and balances.
 • Central bank rates for the top 5 currencies (Euro, GBP, etc.).
 • Exception rate pricing for Euro, GBP, etc.
 • Consolidated balance amount with links to details on specific currencies.
 • Details should include the accounts with exception rate pricing within each 
currency.
 • Limited to 5 or 6 currencies with credit interest exceptions.
 MCA
 • Speaker is sure they can take off a few more things but thinks it's good for now.
 Operations Manager
 • Jared and Hannah will handle this.
 • Hannah says a lot of it is the volumes and types of requests that come through.
 • Requests include:
 • DACA opportunity decisioning
 • DACA implementation
 • Midlife stuff
 • End of life (terminations)
 • TO-DOs: dashboarding, stats on account, DDA changes, warning system.
 • Monthly billing is important.
 • Currently, they push it to CAA.
 
• They want automation and to easily identify which accounts should be on the list.
 • Identifying characteristics such as what segments.
 • How many DACAs do we get on a month from commercial banking, real estate, 
etc.
 • Who are the main people submitting these requests?
 • The main team, OSRM's, if there is a pattern.
 Team Manager Side
 • Volumes around what came through and breaking it up by life cycle stages.
 • Automation around billing information to push to CAA and characteristics by segment.
 • Add a post-it note with name or email/chat if there are any issues.
 Connor
 • Majority of the stuff that he pulls is pretty similar to Tim and Alicia.
 • Large deposit notifications.
 • Analysts help with certain tableau reporting that pulls in certain accounts with DACA 
coding, SD coding.
 • "So there's a field in core that is related to dacas and we pull in all the core 
accounts that have that specific coding and then we pull also accounts that have 
that coding and what type of holds long term holds they have."
 • Analysts do the monthly liquidity packet.
 Jody
 • Same as.
 • Product owner wants to know where the projects are.
 • Red, yellow, green on projects.
 • They want to know if there's any severity tickets open deduction issues on their systems.
 Tickets
 
• Speaker asks where they are at with tickets.
 • Speaker is sure they can get more granular as they go.
 Conclusion
 • Speaker thinks it is a good place to stop.
 • They will spend time digesting everything and get back with individual workshops or 
ideas.
 • "We'll spend some time processing all of this. So thank you everyone. If there's anything 
else that comes up, feel free to."
