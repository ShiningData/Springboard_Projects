I hope this message finds you well and that you’re having a pleasant Friday. Due to a scheduling conflict, I need to cancel today’s meeting and propose a change to our bi-weekly meeting times.

Moving forward, I would like to reschedule our bi-weekly meetings to Fridays from 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM, if this fits everyone’s schedule. Please let me know if this new timing works for you or if there are any conflicts. If this time isn’t suitable, feel free to suggest alternatives based on your availability.

If there are any topics or updates you would like to discuss today despite the cancellation, please feel free to schedule a time directly on my calendar.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,
