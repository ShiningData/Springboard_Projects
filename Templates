Subject: Next Steps for Claim Predictor Model and App Development

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. Below, I have outlined the next steps we will take to advance the claim predictor model and app development, including a timeline adjustment request:

1. We will leverage the existing claim predictor model’s web app design and schedule a meeting to discuss the collaborative construction of our Streamlit application.
  
2. A comprehensive module for exploratory data analysis (EDA) statistics and plots will be developed and tested.

3. We will create a detailed end-to-end model pipeline diagram, which will be incorporated into the application to provide a clear visualization of the process flow.

4. A working session will be organized with Saeed and the Data Engineering team to thoroughly review the code base and initiate both application and data engineering tasks.

5. Saeed will focus on the Streamlit app development, integrating the API to enable inference, and rendering the relevant charts and plots on the dashboard.

6. We will develop a model interpretability module, ensuring the output is both accessible and understandable. This will be tested with both small and full datasets to ensure clarity.

7. The full model training and inference pipeline will be executed on the FMOL and Grady datasets, resolving any issues as they arise.

8. The Streamlit UI will undergo rigorous testing with both test datasets and the full data load to ensure robustness and accuracy.

9. Sundeep/Surya will finalize and test the API integration, ensuring the request/response workload is stable and efficient.

10. We previously met with Amanda’s team to discuss potential feature requests. If we receive any new feature requirements, we will promptly update the code base to accommodate them.

11. Given our current priorities, we request to postpone our follow-up meeting with Amanda’s team from November 5th to November 12th, if that is feasible for all stakeholders.

Please let me know if you require any further details or adjustments to the proposed plan. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
