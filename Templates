During my tenure at a tech startup, our company adopted a collaborative approach to roadmap development. Key stakeholders included the product manager, technical leads, and occasionally, a select group of customers who provided valuable feedback. Decisions were made collectively, considering factors such as business strategy, customer needs, technological feasibility, and resource availability. 

The roadmap was updated quarterly, which allowed us to remain agile yet focused. Interim updates were done as required based on customer feedback or unexpected market shifts. This routine allowed the teams to plan, prepare, and deliver effectively.

The strength of our process was the inclusive decision-making. It fostered a sense of ownership and alignment across the team. However, a point of improvement could have been better communication of changes. Although updates were shared in team meetings, the rationale behind some shifts wasn't always fully clarified. This occasionally led to confusion or misaligned expectations. 

In retrospect, establishing a more systematic and transparent communication process for updates could have ensured all stakeholders had a clear understanding of our roadmap's evolving landscape and the reasons behind the changes, fostering even stronger cohesion and commitment.
