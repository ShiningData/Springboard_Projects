Subject: Thank You for Attending Today's Presentation - Follow-up and Next Steps

Dear [Team/All],

I want to start by expressing my sincere thanks to everyone who attended today's presentation on our machine learning model training and prediction pipeline. Your engagement and thoughtful questions made our discussion lively and productive.

In response to the interest expressed, I am working on scheduling a follow-up technical meeting later this week where we will delve deeper into how to effectively provide data to our model and interpret its predictions. I will share more information, including the exact date and time, as soon as these details are confirmed.

Additionally, I understand that having the presentation slides would be helpful for all of you. I have attached the slides to this email for your convenience. Please feel free to review them at your leisure and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss any points in more detail.

I look forward to continuing our discussions during our upcoming meeting and exploring how we can collectively drive this project towards success.

Thank you once again for your active participation and dedication.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
