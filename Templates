Sure, let’s address question 2 by incorporating the provided details with a general explanation suitable for the Model Initiation Form:

**Summarize the estimation approach or methodology to be employed and the outcome to be estimated, forecasted or inferred.**

The DSI-Commercial Card Control Center utilizes a sophisticated ensemble of forecasting methodologies to estimate, forecast, and infer spend and interchange data for PNC’s range of commercial card products, which includes Commercial Card, Corporate Card, Purchasing Card, Commercial Rewards Card, and Fleet Card. This ensemble leverages state-of-the-art algorithms like ARIMA, XGBoost, Prophet, Neural Prophet, and several others, including the cutting-edge Temporal Fusion Transformer. This diverse array enables the model to train on time series data and produce accurate, reliable forecasts.

Each algorithm contributes its strengths to the overall forecast, with the model selecting the best-performing forecast for each prediction horizon through performance metrics and hyperparameter values. This multi-model approach ensures robustness and adaptability, providing PNC with a powerful tool for financial planning and decision-making.

While this specific application is designed for PNC’s commercial card products, the underlying methodology is flexible and can be generalized to other business contexts. In a broader sense, this model framework can be adapted to forecast various key business metrics, thanks to its comprehensive, data-driven, and algorithmically diverse nature. Such adaptability will be detailed further in later sections, highlighting the model’s universal applicability to other business forecasting needs.
