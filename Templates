Certainly! Here are the elaborated KPIs:

- **Achieve full automation** by ensuring 100% of the PME and PRT rule tracking processes are automated, eliminating the need for manual intervention and streamlining the workflow.
  
- **Maintain superior data processing accuracy** by achieving and sustaining an accuracy rate of over 99% in automated data extractions, ensuring the reliability of the data for decision-making.
  
- **Ensure precise tracking** by consistently monitoring the application frequency of each PME/PRT rule monthly and cumulatively over six months, providing a clear view of usage trends.
  
- **Calculate usage changes meticulously** by accurately determining the 'Usage %+-' for each rule, reflecting even slight variations in usage compared to the previous six-month period.
  
- **Implement decision logic flawlessly** with an accuracy target of 100% for the 'Outcomes' feature, ensuring that every rule's decision reflects the established business logic without errors.
  
- **Boost system adoption rates** by engaging users and securing a high rate of adoption for the automated system within the first quarter after deployment, demonstrating its ease of use and value.
  
- **Reduce reporting time significantly** by cutting the time required to generate reports by at least 50%, thereby enhancing efficiency and freeing up time for more strategic tasks.
  
- **Maximize system reliability and availability** by ensuring the application maintains an uptime of 99.9% and keeping system error rates to an absolute minimum, providing users with constant and dependable access.
  
- **Streamline user interaction with the system** by creating an intuitive and user-friendly experience that allows users to filter, view, and export data with ease, as evidenced by high user satisfaction scores.
  
- **Complete seamless integration** with the DSI Metrics Farm by ensuring all metrics are reflected accurately and without discrepancies, providing a unified and reliable source of data for the organization.
  
- **Decrease manual labor and time expenditure** by significantly reducing the hours spent on rule tracking processes each month, quantifiable through time-tracking metrics and reported time savings.
