At State Farm, I've been part of a wide variety of projects. One that received full cross-functional support was our Predictive Modeling initiative for risk assessment. This project aimed to improve our underwriting process and pricing models. The project was kicked off with a comprehensive presentation outlining the issues with our existing model and the benefits of the proposed changes. Every department was involved, fostering a sense of shared responsibility. The project was completed ahead of schedule, leading to a more accurate risk assessment and improved pricing model.

On the flip side, a project to incorporate real-time data into our claim processing system faced internal resistance. Despite its potential benefits, the project was perceived as a technical burden by some departments, primarily due to a lack of understanding and inadequate communication. This led to delays, and the final product did not meet expectations.

Looking back, we could have managed the situation better. Ensuring that all teams understood the project's value, seeking their inputs early, and maintaining open communication channels would have increased buy-in and support. These experiences have reinforced to me the crucial role of effective communication and inclusive planning in driving project success.
