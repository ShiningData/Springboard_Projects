Conduct sensitivity analysis on interest rate change on deposit balance via dynamic panel data analysis using python as stated below:
Dynamic Panel Data Analysis:
Apply dynamic panel data models to analyze the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes while accounting for individual heterogeneity and time dynamics.
Control for unobserved individual effects and endogeneity issues using appropriate panel data techniques.
The linearmodels package in Python provides functionalities for dynamic panel data analysis.

To conduct sensitivity analysis on the impact of interest rate changes on deposit balance using dynamic panel data analysis in Python, you can use the `linearmodels` package. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: If you haven't already installed `linearmodels`, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install linearmodels
```

2. **Prepare Data**: Prepare your panel data for analysis, ensuring that you have data on both interest rate changes and deposit balances across multiple individuals and time periods.

3. **Specify Model**: Specify the dynamic panel data model that captures the relationship between interest rate changes and deposit balances, while controlling for individual heterogeneity and time dynamics.

4. **Estimate Model**: Use the `PanelOLS` class from `linearmodels` to estimate the dynamic panel data model.

5. **Analyze Results**: Analyze the results of the model estimation to understand the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes.

Here's an example of how you can conduct sensitivity analysis using dynamic panel data analysis in Python with the `linearmodels` package:

```python
import pandas as pd
from linearmodels.panel import PanelOLS

# Load panel data (assuming you have a DataFrame with panel data)
panel_data = pd.read_csv('panel_data.csv')

# Specify model formula
formula = 'Deposit_Balance ~ 1 + Interest_Rate + lag(Deposit_Balance, 1) + EntityEffects + TimeEffects'

# Estimate dynamic panel data model
model = PanelOLS.from_formula(formula, data=panel_data)

# Fit the model
results = model.fit()

# Print model summary
print(results)

# Analyze sensitivity of interest rate coefficient and other model parameters
```

In this example:
- We load the panel data containing interest rate changes, deposit balances, and other relevant variables across multiple individuals and time periods.
- We specify the dynamic panel data model formula using the `from_formula` method, which includes the dependent variable (`Deposit_Balance`), the independent variables (`Interest_Rate` and lagged `Deposit_Balance`), and controls for individual and time effects.
- We estimate the dynamic panel data model using the `PanelOLS` class from `linearmodels`.
- We fit the model to the data and obtain the results.
- Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of the coefficients (e.g., the coefficient on `Interest_Rate`) and other model parameters to understand the relationship between interest rate changes and deposit balances while accounting for individual heterogeneity and time dynamics.
