# General Description of Data

## ANSWER:

The healthcare claim denial predictor model leverages historical standard data extracted from 837 and 835 healthcare claim forms spanning an 18-month period from November 2022 to January 2023. All data fields utilized are de-identified/non-PHI compliant, ensuring regulatory compliance while maintaining analytical value. These two data sources (835 and 837 forms) are systematically matched through a proprietary matching algorithm to construct a comprehensive final dataset for each client, which serves as the foundation for model training.

In the training pipeline, we utilize a robust feature set comprising 34 baseline features supplemented by critical denial indicators: adjustmentGroupCode and adjustmentReasonCode. These indicators are sourced from client-specific RMC_ID_BDC_yes.csv files that define the denial reason codes uniquely for each client. This customization is crucial as each client maintains their own RMC_ID_BDC_yes.csv file that specifies which group and reason codes should be classified as denials, allowing for tailored prediction models that accommodate variations in payer behavior and client-specific denial patterns.

For the prediction pipeline, we implement sophisticated feature engineering and entity resolution processes on the incoming data. The system receives 34 raw features which undergo transformation and enrichment to produce 33 model input features (comprising 15 derived features and 18 original features) that feed into the ensemble model. This feature engineering process optimizes the signal-to-noise ratio in the data, enhancing the model's predictive accuracy for identifying claims at high risk of denial.

The complete model dataset is maintained with appropriate access controls and is available for review upon authorized request, subject to compliance with data governance protocols.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
