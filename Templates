curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

After installing, you'll have to add Rust's bin directory to your PATH. The installation will usually suggest how to do this. You can also manually add it by editing your .bashrc or .zshrc file and adding this line:

export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

Then, either restart your terminal or execute source ~/.bashrc or source ~/.zshrc.
