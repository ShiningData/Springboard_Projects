**Description:**
The main page of the churn model dashboard serves as the initial point of interaction for users seeking insights into customer churn. By focusing on an intuitive and visually appealing UI design, users can have a seamless experience navigating the dashboard and comprehending the churn analysis data. The design should incorporate clear layout structures, interactive elements, and placeholders for data visualizations that effectively communicate churn risks and insights. This user-friendly design will empower users, including marketing and customer retention teams, to quickly identify potential churn risks and prioritize their efforts to retain valuable customers.

   - Upon landing on the main page, users should immediately see an overview of the current churn analysis results.
   - Key metrics such as overall churn rate and customer retention rate should be prominently displayed at the top of the page.
   - A visually appealing chart or graph should visualize the churn trend over a specific time period.

2. **Highlight Churn Causes and Recommendations:**
   - Churn causes and recommendations should be presented in a separate section below the overview.
   - Each churn cause should be displayed with an icon or indicator to differentiate it from recommendations.
   - Causes and recommendations should be displayed in bullet points or concise sentences for easy readability.

3. **Top Churn Risk Customer List:**
   - The list of top customers at risk of churn should be displayed in a table format, with columns for customer name, churn risk score, and actions.
   - Actions could include direct links to customer profiles or options to contact the customer.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - The UI design should be responsive, ensuring a consistent and optimal experience across various screen sizes and devices.

   - Typography should be legible and consistent, using appropriate font styles and sizes.

6. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Buttons, links, and icons should be clearly distinguishable and interactive, guiding users to take actions.
   - Hover effects on interactive elements can provide feedback to users when they hover their cursor over them.

7. **Placeholder for Data Visualizations:**
   - Reserve designated areas for integrating data visualizations in the future.
   - These placeholders should indicate where charts or graphs will be displayed to enhance insights.

8. **Loading and Error States:**
   - Implement loading indicators to communicate to users when data is being fetched or processed.
   - In case of errors or unavailable data, display appropriate error messages with guidance on what to do next.

9. **Consistency and Branding:**
   - Maintain consistency with the overall branding of the churn model dashboard, including logo, colors, and styling.

By adhering to these rules and requirements, the main page UI design will deliver a user-friendly, informative, and visually engaging experience for users interacting with the churn model dashboard.
