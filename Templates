To create a detailed tabular data summary of the graph, which includes community membership, `TRAN_CD`, community size, and Jaccard similarity, we will follow these steps:

1. **Community Detection**: As previously implemented, detect communities using the Louvain method.
2. **Create a DataFrame**: Construct a DataFrame that aggregates the necessary information.
3. **Calculate Community Size**: For each community, calculate the number of members.
4. **Calculate Average Jaccard Similarity**: Compute the average Jaccard similarity within each community.

Here's how you can write the Python code to accomplish this:

### Python Code for Summarizing the Graph in a DataFrame

```python
import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx
from sklearn.preprocessing import Binarizer
import community as community_louvain

# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame with columns 'RLTN_PWR_ID', 'TRAN_CD', 'VOLUME'
data_pivot = df.pivot_table(index='RLTN_PWR_ID', columns='TRAN_CD', values='VOLUME', fill_value=0)

# Binarize the data to prepare for Jaccard Similarity
binarizer = Binarizer(threshold=0)
data_binary = binarizer.fit_transform(data_pivot)
data_binary = pd.DataFrame(data_binary, columns=data_pivot.columns).astype(bool)

# Create a graph
G = nx.Graph()

# Add nodes and compute Jaccard similarity to add weighted edges
threshold = 0.1
for i, col1 in enumerate(data_binary.columns):
    for j, col2 in enumerate(data_binary.columns):
        if i < j:
            intersection = data_binary[col1] & data_binary[col2]
            union = data_binary[col1] | data_binary[col2]
            similarity = intersection.sum() / float(union.sum())
            if similarity > threshold:
                G.add_edge(col1, col2, weight=similarity)

# Detecting communities
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G, weight='weight')

# Community Data Extraction
community_data = {
    "TRAN_CD": [],
    "Community": [],
    "Jaccard Similarity": []
}

for u, v, data in G.edges(data=True):
    community_data["TRAN_CD"].append(f"{u}, {v}")
    community_data["Community"].append(f"{partition[u]}, {partition[v]}")
    community_data["Jaccard Similarity"].append(data['weight'])

community_df = pd.DataFrame(community_data)

# Calculate community sizes
community_sizes = community_df['Community'].value_counts().rename_axis('Community').reset_index(name='Size')

# Merge community sizes back to the DataFrame
community_df = community_df.merge(community_sizes, on='Community', how='left')

# Group by community to calculate average Jaccard Similarity
community_df['Average Jaccard Similarity'] = community_df.groupby('Community')['Jaccard Similarity'].transform('mean')

# Drop duplicate communities for the final summary
final_community_df = community_df.drop_duplicates(subset=['Community']).reset_index(drop=True)

# Display the DataFrame
print(final_community_df[['Community', 'Size', 'Average Jaccard Similarity']])
```

### Explanation:

1. **Community Detection**: Communities are detected using the Louvain method, assigning each `TRAN_CD` to a community.
2. **Graph Edges**: The script computes Jaccard similarity between each pair of `TRAN_CD`s and creates edges for those pairs above a similarity threshold.
3. **Community Data**: A DataFrame is created listing each pair of connected `TRAN_CD`s, their community assignment, and the Jaccard similarity for that edge.
4. **Community Size and Average Similarity**: The DataFrame is enhanced to include the size of each community and the average Jaccard similarity within it.

This DataFrame provides a comprehensive summary of your network analysis, highlighting how `TRAN_CD`s are grouped, the connectivity within communities based on Jaccard similarity, and the size of these communities. This structured data format is excellent for further analysis or reporting.
