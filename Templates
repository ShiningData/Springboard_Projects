In the event of an incorrect output, the most significant concern would be the possibility of a user relying on such data for financial decisions, which may not align with the actual fiscal trends. Recognizing this, we have established stringent accuracy benchmarks for the modelâ€™s outputs and actively communicate these parameters to users. This ensures that they are well-informed of the forecast's reliability and can use discretion when making decisions based on the model's data.
