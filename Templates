**Subject:** Re: Advice on Last Semester of AI Masters & Projects to Try

Hi Yichen,

I hope you had a great 4th of July with your family!

Thanks for reaching out. It sounds like you're at an exciting point in your master's program. Here are my thoughts on your questions:

### Course Selection
Both Fuzzy Logic and Quantum Computing are interesting fields. If you're unsure about them, think about how they might fit into your broader goals or help you discover new areas of interest.

### Project Focus
Since you've worked with TensorFlow and Keras and want to dive into PyTorch, here are some ideas:

1. **Beyond Deep Learning**:
   - **Supervised/Unsupervised ML**: It's definitely worth exploring these. Techniques like decision trees, random forests, clustering, and anomaly detection can give you a broader skill set.
   - **Graph Machine Learning**: This is a hot area with applications in social networks, recommendations, and more. Check out PyTorch Geometric.
   - **Bayesian Methods**: These are great for dealing with uncertainty. Libraries like PyMC3 or Stan could be interesting to look into.
   - **PyTorch Projects**: Keep building on your deep learning skills with PyTorch. It's a powerful tool and widely used.

### Project Ideas
For a three-month solo project, here are a few ideas:
   - **NLP**: Try a text classification or sentiment analysis project. Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers are great for this.
   - **Computer Vision**: How about an image classification or object detection project? Datasets like CIFAR-10 or COCO are good starting points.
   - **Reinforcement Learning**: Implement a simple RL algorithm for a game or simulation.
   - **Unsupervised Learning**: Work on clustering techniques, like customer segmentation or anomaly detection.
   - **Graph Neural Networks**: Projects like node classification or link prediction could be cool.
   - **Bayesian Inference**: Dive into probabilistic modeling and inference, maybe for parameter estimation or predictive modeling.

A useful paper to check out might be:
   - **"A Comprehensive Review on Ensemble Deep Learning: Opportunities and Challenges"**. It offers a good overview of combining different models and techniques.

### MLOps and CI/CD
Incorporating MLOps and CI/CD into your projects can really take them to the next level:
   - **MLOps**: Focus on reproducibility, version control, and monitoring. Tools like MLflow, Kubeflow, and DVC are great for this.
   - **CI/CD**: Setting up CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions can automate your testing and deployment processes.

### Final Thoughts
Balancing non-DL ML techniques with your deep learning work in PyTorch will make you a well-rounded AI professional. Adding MLOps and CI/CD practices will ensure your projects are robust and scalable.

If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out. I'm happy to help!

Best,

Engin
