For extracting text from check images, including potentially handwritten or typed names, dates, check numbers, account numbers, routing numbers, and amounts, the OCR tools need to be versatile in handling both printed and handwritten text, with high accuracy and the capability to understand complex layouts typical in financial documents. Here's an updated list focusing on these requirements:

1. **Tesseract-OCR with pytesseract wrapper**: While Tesseract is strong in typed text recognition, its accuracy for handwritten text varies. However, using custom training with check-specific data can improve its performance for such tasks.

7. **CalliScan**: A project or tool specifically designed for handwritten text recognition could be highly beneficial for extracting handwritten information from checks, although a direct link or official repository might not be readily available, focusing on similar technologies or custom development based on deep learning for handwritten OCR is recommended.

8. **Calamari-OCR**: Focused on Optical Character Recognition using deep learning, Calamari offers state-of-the-art accuracy for printed text and has shown promise in handwritten text recognition as well, making it a candidate for processing checks.

9. **Keras-OCR**: A package built for real-world OCR tasks, leveraging the power of Keras and TensorFlow to provide a toolkit for detecting and recognizing text. With customization, it could be adapted for the specifics of check processing.

10. **Handwritten Text Recognition with TensorFlow**: While not a package but a methodology, utilizing TensorFlow to build a custom model trained on a dataset of handwritten checks could yield the highest accuracy for specific use cases like extracting text from checks.
   
For projects focusing on extracting data from checks, combining one or more of these tools with custom preprocessing steps (such as image enhancement and segmentation) and post-processing (such as validation of check details against predefined formats) can significantly improve accuracy and reliability. Leveraging deep learning models trained on datasets that include images of checks could also enhance the performance for both printed and handwritten text recognition tasks.
