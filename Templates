# 3.2 Data Quality and Representativeness

Our healthcare claim denial predictor implements a sophisticated data quality assurance framework throughout the production pipeline, which integrates 837 claim submission data with corresponding 835 remittance advice information. This framework encompasses multiple validation protocols to ensure optimal data integrity and model performance:

## Quality Assurance Protocols

1. **Type Conformance Validation**: The system executes comprehensive validation of data types across all columns, comparing incoming data against predefined specifications to ensure structural consistency and prevent type-related anomalies during processing.

2. **Mandatory Field Completeness**: The system systematically excludes records with null values in business-critical fieldsâ€”specifically claimUniqueId, serviceLineProcedureCode, and payerName. This quality control measure ensures prediction generation occurs only for service lines with complete essential information, preserving the integrity of the prediction outputs.

3. **Categorical Domain Monitoring**: Automated detection mechanisms identify novel categorical values in production data that were not present in the original training datasets from Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System (FMOL) and Grady Health System. This monitoring enables appropriate handling of emerging categorical values to maintain model robustness.

## Feature Engineering and Response Definition

The model leverages a carefully curated feature set that combines direct extractions from 837 EDI transactions with engineered features designed to capture complex relationships within claims data. This engineering process transforms raw transactional attributes into meaningful predictive indicators.

The target variable definition (denial status) employs a sophisticated mapping methodology tailored to each healthcare organization's specific workflows. This mapping correlates Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARCs) from remittance advice exports obtained from Epic EHR systems with the creation of Bad Debt Collection (BDC) records. This client-specific approach ensures the model's definition of "denial" precisely aligns with each organization's revenue cycle operations and financial classification systems.

This methodical approach to data quality management and feature engineering establishes a foundation for reliable predictions that accurately reflect the likelihood of claim denials within each healthcare organization's unique payer environment.
