I hope this message finds you well. Our team has been diligently preparing the updated Model Risk Management Guidance (MRMG) documentation for the MRMG team's review. I have compiled all relevant documents in the SharePoint folder for your assessment prior to our scheduled meeting on Friday, during which we plan to submit this folder to the MRMG team.

I have drafted the majority of the content, and Chris is currently reviewing and updating it as necessary. We value your feedback and guidance in this process. Please feel free to reach out to me before our meeting if you require any additional information or documentation.
