As a data scientist working on a multiclass classification problem with an imbalanced dataset, you are using the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Before discussing why you chose the F1 score, let's define Precision and Recall in the context of this case.

1. Precision:
Precision, also known as Positive Predictive Value (PPV), measures the accuracy of positive predictions made by the model. In the context of multiclass classification, precision is calculated for each class separately. For a particular class, precision is the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly classified instances of that class) to the total instances predicted as positive for that class. A higher precision indicates that the model is making fewer false positive predictions for that class.

Formula for Precision of class "C":
\[ \text{Precision(C)} = \frac{\text{True Positives (C)}}{\text{True Positives (C)} + \text{False Positives (C)}} \]

2. Recall:
Recall, also known as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (TPR), measures the ability of the model to capture all positive instances of a class. In the context of multiclass classification, recall is calculated for each class separately. It is the ratio of true positive predictions for a particular class to the total actual instances of that class. A higher recall indicates that the model is effectively identifying most of the positive instances of that class.

Formula for Recall of class "C":
\[ \text{Recall(C)} = \frac{\text{True Positives (C)}}{\text{True Positives (C)} + \text{False Negatives (C)}} \]

Now, let's discuss why you chose the F1 score in this case with imbalanced categories:

In imbalanced datasets, some classes may have significantly more instances than others, making it challenging for the model to perform well on minority classes. Accuracy alone can be misleading in such cases because it may be high due to the dominant classes, while the model might struggle to perform well on the minority classes.

F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it takes both false positives and false negatives into account. It is well-suited for imbalanced datasets because it balances precision and recall, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across all classes.

Formula for F1 score of class "C":
\[ \text{F1 score(C)} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision(C)} \times \text{Recall(C)}}{\text{Precision(C)} + \text{Recall(C)}} \]

By using the F1 score, you are considering the trade-off between precision and recall, making it a more suitable metric to assess the performance of your multiclass classification model on an imbalanced dataset. A high F1 score indicates that the model is both precise and able to capture most of the positive instances, which is desirable when dealing with imbalanced classes.
