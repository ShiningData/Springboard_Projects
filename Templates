Our digital channels platform team aimed to find an efficient and cost-effective way of customer authentication service. Currently, our company is conducting this process with a vendor and our team wants to remove this vendor it from the process and do the authentication by itself. For that reason, they connect to me. I need to make 6 interviews with different branch of this process to understand the process, bottleneck, and better solution that can replace the current vendor. First challenge that I face was to find the right point of connect at the different level of this process. I want to understand the problem from every angle such as business, technology, platform, authentication response code logic, documentation, and data integration. To do my job easier, before starting interview, I requested available resources that I can work on and understand the current workflow and its’ problems. I did my homework well and prepared my questions. That was extremely helpful. Starting with broad questions and narrowing down into a specific area elicited more clear understanding. What is the current workflow of the process? Walk me through each step of this process. How do you authenticate customers real identity? These broad questions help me to grasp the status and then I narrowed down the question like ‘what response code does your pipeline return for customer authentication? What should I understand from each of this response code? What happens any of this response code does not align with the given customer data ? Another challenge I face here was their interior policy how to handle data privacy when replacing the current workflow. They don’t have clear roadmap for that, and it is a decision point for me when I create a system design for what they expect from me. They are busy for now clearing this bottleneck.
