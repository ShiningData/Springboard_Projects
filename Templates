Subject: Initiation of MRMG Process and Submission of Model Documents

Dear Model Review and Approval Team,

I hope this email finds you well. 

I am writing to formally initiate the Model Risk Management Group (MRMG) review process for the new model I have developed. Over the past few months, I have worked collaboratively with various members of our team to refine this model, and I am confident that it will bring significant value to our operations.

I have completed the Model Initiation and Tiering Template, which provide a comprehensive overview of the model and its functionality. Both of these documents have been thoroughly reviewed in consultation with Chris, our Product Manager, and Badel, my direct supervisor. I believe that our collective insights and expertise have allowed us to create a robust and reliable model.

Please find attached the Model Initiation and Tiering Template documents for your review. They offer a detailed summary of the model's design, expected uses, potential risks, and mitigation strategies.

I am the primary point of contact for any questions or clarifications you may need during your review process. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email, phone, or any other means convenient for you. I am more than happy to facilitate discussions or meetings to ensure you have a clear understanding of our model.

I look forward to working with the Model Review and Approval team to navigate through the MRMG review process and receive approval for our model.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Best regards,
