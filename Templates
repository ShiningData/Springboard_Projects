Dear [Manager's Name],

I trust this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to you ahead of our scheduled career development meeting with the aim of outlining my career goals, as well as seeking your advice and support to achieve them.

1. **Full Stack Data Scientist Aspiration**: One of my primary objectives is to develop and utilize the necessary skills to become a full stack data scientist at PNC. I understand the complexity and depth of this role, and I am eager to master the PNC tools and capacities needed to succeed. I'd appreciate your guidance on specific training programs or opportunities within our team that I can engage in to further my understanding and proficiency in these tools.

2. **Leadership Role Goal**: My long-term career vision includes evolving into a Lead Data Scientist. I am keen to broaden my skillset and experience to qualify for this role in the future. I would value your support and any opportunities that will help me grow in this direction. I'm particularly interested in projects or tasks that could allow me to showcase and develop my leadership abilities.

3. **Client Communication and Political Acumen**: I am aware that a comprehensive skillset for a data scientist goes beyond the technical abilities. I am therefore committed to enhancing my skills in client communication and understanding the dynamics of organizational politics. Given your vast experience and expertise in this area, I would appreciate any advice or resources that you believe would benefit me in this aspect.

4. **Data Engineering Bootcamp**: To further strengthen my technical skills, I am considering enrolling in a 'Data Engineering Bootcamp'. I understand that this program will offer deep insights into data infrastructure, which is crucial for my role and future aspirations. I seek your support to leverage our company's educational benefits for this opportunity.

5. **Technical Career Path Preference**: I would like to mention that my career goals are strongly aligned with continuing on a technical path. I believe in focusing and growing in areas where my passion and skills lie, and I have always found myself gravitating towards more technical roles. I would appreciate any guidance you could provide in how I can plan my career path to align with this preference.

I look forward to discussing these goals and receiving your invaluable feedback during our meeting. I am optimistic that with your guidance, I can effectively chart my career path to align with PNC's mission and my professional aspirations. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Best Regards,
