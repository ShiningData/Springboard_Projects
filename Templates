 1. Business Value of PME/PRT Rules Report
   - The report enables ongoing monitoring of business rules (used and unused) to maintain application hygiene and address observations raised by regulators (OC) in 2022.
   - It helps identify rules that are obsolete and no longer in use, improving efficiency and system organization.
   - This contributes to better management and understanding of the PME and PRT platforms, which were identified as relatively new and maturing systems.

 2. Purpose of Current Functions
   - The automation focuses on reducing manual work (e.g., generating pivot tables and linking to other reports), saving hours for the team and MIS.
   - The automated process consolidates all necessary data in a central database, reducing redundancy and enhancing workflow efficiency.

 3. Expected Benefits of Automation
   - Significant time savings for the team, enabling focus on data analysis rather than report generation.
   - Centralized storage of data, eliminating the need for repeated spreadsheet creation and manual processes.
   - Improved readiness for potential audits and streamlined presentation of information to upper management.

 4. Regulatory Implications
   - No regulatory bodies need to be notified regarding the automation.
   - An audit by regulators is possible due to previous observations by OC, so it is beneficial to have these automated processes and reports in place to address such inquiries efficiently.

 5. Summary Presentation of PME/PRT Report
   - A one-page tier sheet document will be created, including dashboard visuals, business rule statuses, review outcomes, and pie charts.
   - It will be organized into two sections (PME and PRT) on a single page for clarity and concise presentation.
   - Additional elements, such as statistical summaries, can be included if necessary.
