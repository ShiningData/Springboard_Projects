Conduct sensitivity analysis on interest rate changes impact on deposit balance via Bootstrap Sampling techniques as stated below in python:
Use bootstrap resampling to estimate the variability of sensitivity analysis results and assess the robustness of your findings.
Generate multiple bootstrap samples from your dataset, perform sensitivity analysis on each sample, and examine the distribution of sensitivity metrics.
The bootstrapped package in Python provides functionalities for bootstrap resampling.

Certainly! Here's how you can conduct sensitivity analysis on the impact of interest rate changes on deposit balance using Bootstrap Sampling techniques in Python with the `bootstrapped` package:

1. **Install the bootstrapped Package**: If you haven't already installed the bootstrapped package, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install bootstrapped
```

2. **Define Sensitivity Analysis Function**: Define a function to perform sensitivity analysis on interest rate changes and deposit balance. This function will estimate sensitivity metrics from a given sample.

3. **Bootstrap Resampling**: Use bootstrapped resampling to generate multiple bootstrap samples from the dataset.

4. **Perform Sensitivity Analysis on Bootstrap Samples**: For each bootstrap sample, apply the sensitivity analysis function to estimate sensitivity metrics.

5. **Examine the Distribution of Sensitivity Metrics**: Analyze the distribution of sensitivity metrics obtained from bootstrap samples to understand the variability and robustness of the findings.

Here's an example of how you can conduct sensitivity analysis using Bootstrap Sampling techniques in Python with the bootstrapped package:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from bootstrapped.bootstrap import bootstrap
from bootstrapped.stats_functions import mean, std_dev

# Define Sensitivity Analysis Function
def sensitivity_analysis(interest_rate_changes, deposit_balances):
    # Perform sensitivity analysis (replace with your analysis)
    # Example: Calculate correlation coefficient between interest rate changes and deposit balances
    correlation_coefficient = np.corrcoef(interest_rate_changes, deposit_balances)[0, 1]
    return correlation_coefficient

# Load Dataset (assuming you have a DataFrame with deposit balance and interest rate data)
data = pd.read_csv('deposit_data.csv')

# Extract Interest Rate Changes and Deposit Balances
interest_rate_changes = data['Interest_Rate'].values
deposit_balances = data['Deposit_Balance'].values

# Define Number of Bootstrap Samples
num_bootstrap_samples = 1000

# Perform Bootstrap Resampling and Sensitivity Analysis
bootstrap_results = bootstrap(
    interest_rate_changes, 
    deposit_balances, 
    num_iterations=num_bootstrap_samples, 
    stat_func=sensitivity_analysis
)

# Extract Sensitivity Metrics from Bootstrap Results
sensitivity_metrics = bootstrap_results.apply(mean, axis=0)  # Mean of sensitivity metrics
sensitivity_metrics_std = bootstrap_results.apply(std_dev, axis=0)  # Standard deviation of sensitivity metrics

# Analyze the Distribution of Sensitivity Metrics
print("Mean Sensitivity Metrics:", sensitivity_metrics)
print("Standard Deviation of Sensitivity Metrics:", sensitivity_metrics_std)
```

In this example:
- We define a sensitivity analysis function (`sensitivity_analysis`) to calculate sensitivity metrics for interest rate changes and deposit balances. You can replace this function with your own sensitivity analysis.
- We load the dataset containing deposit balance and interest rate data.
- We extract interest rate changes and deposit balances from the dataset.
- We use bootstrapped resampling to generate multiple bootstrap samples from the dataset.
- For each bootstrap sample, we apply the sensitivity analysis function to estimate sensitivity metrics.
- Finally, we analyze the distribution of sensitivity metrics obtained from bootstrap samples to understand the variability and robustness of the findings.
