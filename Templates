The complexity and uncertainty inherent in the model’s inputs, outputs, and assumptions are rigorously evaluated using the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) as a key performance metric. SMAPE provides a quantitative measure of forecasting accuracy, where a lower value indicates a higher precision and less uncertainty in the forecast outcomes. By utilizing SMAPE, we ensure a methodical approach to gauging the model's reliability, thereby enhancing the credibility of the insights it generates for decision-making processes.
