# PII and PHI Data Management

Our healthcare claim denial predictor model operates under a comprehensive data governance framework that prioritizes the security and confidentiality of sensitive healthcare information. All data exchange processes with client healthcare organizations adhere to industry-leading security protocols:

- **Secure File Transmission**: Data transmissions utilize established health data-sensitive protocols, implemented through Enterprise File Transfer (EFX) and Connect Direct systems. EFX serves as our dedicated team managing SFTP transmissions from external healthcare partners with appropriate encryption and authentication measures. Once received, Connect Direct facilitates secure internal file transfers from the EFX platform to the designated processing environment within our secure infrastructure.

- **PHI/PII Exclusion Verification**: We have conducted rigorous column-level validation to ensure all data elements incorporated in our model are exclusively non-PHI related. This verification process was executed in collaboration with our internal compliance stakeholders and data governance specialists to confirm adherence to HIPAA regulations and organizational data handling policies.

- **Enhanced Storage Security**: As an additional safeguard, all model data is housed within a PHI-certified server environment within our Technical Development Laboratory (TDL). This measure provides an extra layer of protection, implementing technical controls that meet or exceed regulatory requirements for protected health information, despite our model utilizing only de-identified data.

This multi-layered approach to data privacy and security demonstrates our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of compliance while delivering advanced predictive capabilities for healthcare revenue cycle management.
