When interpreting the results of the Granger Causality Test, you'll typically focus on the statistical significance levels and F-statistics for each lag. Here's how you can interpret them:

### Significance Levels:
- The significance levels (often denoted as p-values) indicate the probability of observing the test statistic (F-statistic) as extreme as or more extreme than what is observed in the data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
- A significance level less than a chosen threshold (commonly 0.05 or 0.01) suggests that you reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, indicating evidence of Granger causality.
- Conversely, a significance level greater than the chosen threshold suggests that you fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating no evidence of Granger causality.
- It's essential to consider the chosen significance threshold and adjust it for multiple comparisons if necessary.

### F-Statistics:
- The F-statistic is a measure of the overall significance of the Granger causality test. It assesses whether there is a statistically significant relationship between the lagged values of the potential causal variable (e.g., interest rate changes) and the current values of the dependent variable (e.g., deposit balances), after accounting for the other variables in the model.
- Higher values of the F-statistic indicate stronger evidence against the null hypothesis of no causality.
- The F-statistic is typically compared to critical values from the F-distribution to determine statistical significance.

### Interpretation:
- If the p-value associated with the F-statistic is less than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), you have evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no Granger causality. In this case, you would conclude that there is Granger causality from the potential causal variable to the dependent variable.
- Conversely, if the p-value is greater than the chosen significance level, you fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating no evidence of Granger causality.
- It's essential to interpret the results cautiously, considering factors such as model specification, sample size, and potential confounding variables.

In summary, you interpret the Granger Causality Test results by assessing the significance levels and F-statistics. Statistical significance indicates evidence for or against Granger causality, while the F-statistic measures the overall strength of the relationship between variables.
