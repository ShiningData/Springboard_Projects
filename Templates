1. Data Drift Analysis:
Data drift refers to changes in the distribution of the input features over time. In this script, it is analyzed separately for categorical and numerical features:

Categorical Features:
For each categorical feature, the distribution of each category (e.g., "Y", "N", "U", "C", "MISSING") is compared between the reference dataset and the current dataset.
The comparison is performed using Jensen-Shannon distance, a metric that measures the similarity between two probability distributions. If this distance is high, it indicates a drift in the feature's distribution, implying that the current data is not similar to the reference data.
Numerical Features:
For numerical features, the script creates histograms for both the reference and current data, calculating the frequency distribution in each bin.
The Jensen-Shannon distance is also used here to compare the histogram distributions. A high distance score indicates a significant drift, meaning that the numerical feature's distribution has changed over time.
2. Target Drift Analysis:
Target drift measures changes in the distribution of the target variable between the reference dataset and the current dataset.

The reference and current distributions of the target variable are calculated and displayed in a tabular format.
The table shows the proportion of each target value in both the reference and current datasets, helping identify any shifts in the target variable's behavior over time.
For example, if the proportion of a specific target class has significantly decreased, it may indicate that the underlying patterns have changed.

3. Concept Drift Analysis:
Concept drift refers to changes in the relationship between input features and the target variable over time.

In this script, concept drift is estimated based on rule validation success rates for both the reference and current datasets.
The validation success rate is calculated by checking how well the predefined rules align with the reference and current datasets.
If the difference in validation success rates is greater than a threshold (0.1 in this script), it indicates significant concept drift. Concept drift suggests that the existing rules may no longer be valid for the current data, and the model may need retraining.
Summary:

Data Drift: Examines changes in input feature distributions (using Jensen-Shannon distance for both categorical and numerical features).
Target Drift: Compares the target variable's distribution between the reference and current datasets.
Concept Drift: Monitors changes in the relationship between features and the target variable by evaluating rule validation success rates.
