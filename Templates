1. **Financial Cost**: This involves the total budget allocated for the product development, including the cost of the infrastructure, software tools, and hardware necessary for building and deploying the model. 

2. **Engineering Effort Cost**: The cost associated with the human resources involved in the project, such as data scientists, engineers, designers, and quality assurance personnel. This includes not only their salaries, but also the costs of training and upskilling them, if necessary.

3. **Time-based Risk**: Any delays in development and deployment could have significant financial implications. Hence, creating and sticking to a realistic timeline is crucial. This also includes the time necessary for training, testing, and iterating the model.

4. **Regulatory Issues**: Depending on the domain and the region, various regulations (such as GDPR in Europe, CCPA in California, etc.) might apply, especially if the model handles sensitive or personal data. Ensuring compliance is a major consideration.

5. **Data Quality and Availability**: High quality, relevant data is the cornerstone of any machine learning model. We need to assess the availability of such data and possibly the cost and effort involved in data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing.

6. **Scalability**: As the number of users increase, the system should be able to handle the increasing load. Hence, considerations about the scalability of the infrastructure, the model, and the associated data pipelines is important.

7. **Security**: This involves ensuring the safety of the data, the model, and the infrastructure from potential breaches and attacks. This includes considerations around data encryption, access controls, and auditing.

8. **Maintainability and Monitoring**: After deployment, the model should be easy to maintain and monitor. It involves setting up processes for continuous monitoring, logging, alerting, updating the model, and troubleshooting any issues.

9. **Integration with Existing Systems**: How well the new service can be integrated with existing systems and services is also a key factor to consider. This could involve considering things like API compatibility, data formats, and networking considerations.

10. **User Acceptance**: Lastly, how well the end users receive the new service is paramount to its success. Thus, user testing, feedback, and subsequent iterations based on this feedback should be taken into consideration. This includes considering the ease-of-use, documentation, and the general user experience of the microservice.
