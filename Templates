Hereâ€™s a professional response that merges the content from all speakers:

"With the current allocation of 1 vCPU and 6GB of memory, we are encountering several limitations. Firstly, processing large datasets, particularly during exploratory data analysis (EDA), becomes unmanageable due to memory constraints, as the data often exceeds available capacity. Additionally, we are unable to prototype GPU-based models as the notebook environment does not support GPU selection. Furthermore, memory limitations are particularly evident when converting large datasets from sources such as Hadoop, CSV, or Neo4j into graph structures using libraries like NetworkX or iGraph, where handling hundreds of thousands of data records requires significantly higher memory capacity."

This response consolidates all points and conveys the challenges in a concise and professional tone.
