**What worked well?**

In the churn model product project, several aspects worked well during the development of the clickable prototype. Firstly, the organization of the dashboard into three distinct pages was effective in providing users with a clear and intuitive navigation experience. The main page with churn analysis and churn causes/recommendations allowed users to quickly understand the churn-related insights and potential actions to mitigate it. The inclusion of the churn risk top customer list also provided valuable information to prioritize efforts. The second page, focusing on churn's impact on revenue and retention, offered valuable visualizations with graphs, allowing stakeholders to grasp the overall business implications of churn. The use of clear icons (home, graph, and machine learning) facilitated easy access to specific sections, ensuring seamless user interaction.

Secondly, the incorporation of a comprehensive model feature on the last page was beneficial for the users, especially for those with a technical background. The presence of train and prediction information helped the audience understand the model's workings and performance, instilling confidence in its accuracy and reliability. By providing insights into how the model was trained and its predictive capabilities, users could better align their decision-making processes with the model's outputs.

**What didn't work well?**

Despite the successes, a few aspects of the clickable prototype did not work well. One issue was related to user feedback during the testing phase. While the organization of pages was intuitive for some users, others found it challenging to remember which icon led to a specific page, leading to confusion and navigation difficulties. This feedback highlighted the need for improved visual cues and labels to enhance the user experience.

Another area of improvement was the presentation of churn impact on revenue and retention information. While the graphs were helpful, some users felt overwhelmed with the volume of data and had difficulty interpreting the insights. To address this, a more streamlined visualization approach or interactive elements could be explored to enable users to focus on specific data points and dive deeper into the analysis.

**What did you discover?**

Throughout the development of the clickable prototype, several important discoveries emerged. The most significant one was the diverse nature of the end-users' backgrounds and expertise. Some users were more business-oriented and required straightforward insights to make informed decisions, while others, particularly technical stakeholders, sought detailed information about the underlying model. This finding underscored the importance of striking the right balance in presenting information that caters to both types of users.

Additionally, user testing highlighted the necessity of continually iterating and refining the prototype based on feedback. While the initial design was well-conceived, incorporating real user feedback was crucial in identifying pain points and refining the user interface to enhance usability and overall satisfaction.

Lastly, the clickable prototype revealed the potential for further exploration of interactive features within the graphs and visualizations. Interactive elements could empower users to customize their views and obtain specific insights relevant to their unique needs, improving engagement and understanding of the churn data.

By addressing the areas that didn't work well and capitalizing on the positive discoveries, the churn model dashboard can be further optimized to deliver a compelling and user-friendly experience, ultimately driving better business decision-making and customer retention strategies.
