Conduct sensitivity analysis for the interest rate change on deposit balance by applying Sensitivity Indices approach in python as stated below:
Calculate sensitivity indices such as first-order, second-order, and total-order indices using methods like Sobol' indices.
These indices quantify the relative importance of interest rate changes compared to other factors influencing deposit balances.
Implementations of sensitivity indices calculations can be found in packages like SALib (Sensitivity Analysis Library) in Python.
