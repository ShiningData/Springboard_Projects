**Data Scientist:**

Responsibilities:
- Develop and maintain the churn prediction model using machine learning techniques.
- Analyze and interpret large datasets to identify churn patterns and customer behavior trends.
- Collaborate with the product manager and data analyst to define churn-related KPIs and metrics.
- Conduct A/B tests and experiments to validate model performance and refine predictive algorithms.
- Continuously monitor and improve the model's accuracy and robustness.

Notes/Potential Friction Areas:
- Data scientists may require access to large and diverse datasets, which could lead to potential friction with data engineers in terms of data access and data integration.
- Balancing model complexity and interpretability may cause conflicts with the product manager's preference for simplicity and transparency in presenting churn insights to stakeholders.

**Data Analyst:**

Responsibilities:
- Collect, clean, and preprocess data from various sources to ensure its usability for analysis.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns related to churn and customer retention.
- Create and maintain visualizations and dashboards to communicate churn-related insights to stakeholders.
- Collaborate with the data engineer and data scientist to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

Notes/Potential Friction Areas:
- Data analysts may require access to timely and accurate data, leading to potential conflicts with data engineers if there are delays in data processing and integration.
- Balancing the depth of analysis and the simplicity of communication in visualizations may cause disagreements with the product manager's preference for concise and actionable insights.

**Data Engineer:**

Responsibilities:
- Design and maintain data pipelines and infrastructure to ensure the smooth flow of data for analysis.
- Develop and manage databases and data warehouses to store large volumes of churn-related data.
- Collaborate with the data scientist and data analyst to ensure data availability and accessibility for analysis.
- Implement and monitor data quality checks to identify and resolve data issues.

Notes/Potential Friction Areas:
- Data engineers may prioritize optimizing data infrastructure and performance, which could lead to potential conflicts with the product manager's focus on feature development and customer-facing improvements.
- Balancing short-term data needs for analysis with long-term scalability and data architecture may cause tensions between data engineers and data scientists.

**Product Manager:**

Responsibilities:
- Define the product vision, goals, and roadmap for the churn model dashboard.
- Prioritize features and enhancements based on user needs and business objectives.
- Coordinate and facilitate communication among data scientists, analysts, engineers, and designers.
- Collaborate with the team to ensure timely and successful delivery of product milestones.

Notes/Potential Friction Areas:
- The product manager's focus on user experience and feature development may conflict with data scientists' and data analysts' technical requirements for the model's accuracy and data access.
- Balancing short-term customer needs and long-term product strategy may cause tensions with data engineers who prioritize data infrastructure and scalability.

**Designer:**

Responsibilities:
- Design and create user interfaces for the churn model dashboard that are visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Conduct user research to understand user needs and pain points related to churn analysis.
- Collaborate with the product manager and data analyst to incorporate user feedback into the design.
- Ensure consistency and usability across all pages and interactions within the dashboard.

Notes/Potential Friction Areas:
- The designer's focus on aesthetics and user experience may lead to potential conflicts with data scientists and analysts, who prioritize data presentation and information clarity.
- Balancing design creativity with data visualization best practices may cause tensions with the product manager's preference for simplicity and ease of understanding.
