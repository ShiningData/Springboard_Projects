I hope this email finds you well.

As discussed last week, you have arranged the workshop session for Cipher querying on Wednesday. Badel has requested an analysis to determine how many records from the attached CSV file are part of the payment network. Would it be possible to complete this task today? I assume it will not take much time, and Badel plans to make a decision tomorrow regarding further enhancements to OVS based on this data.

You are welcome to review it independently, or we can work on it togetherâ€”whichever is more convenient and efficient for you. Since we have the workshop scheduled for Wednesday, I want to ensure that we do not need to add additional tutorial sessions to your calendar.

The file includes account numbers, routing numbers, and names for verifying if these entities are part of our payment network (primarily counterparties, not PNC bank customers). Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.
