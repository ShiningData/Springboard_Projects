Sure, here is a more detailed explanation for each factor:

1. **Financial Cost**: Financial cost encompasses all expenses associated with the project, including hardware, software, and infrastructure costs. This could involve setting up servers, buying or renting data storage, and acquiring the necessary machine learning and data processing tools. Proper financial planning is necessary to ensure that the project is economically viable and will yield a return on investment.

2. **Engineering Effort Cost**: The human resource cost involved in a project can often be one of the largest expenses. This includes not only the salaries of the engineers, data scientists, and designers working on the project, but also the cost of their training and upskilling. The complexity and novelty of the project may also require hiring or consulting with specialists, which adds to the cost.

3. **Time-based Risk**: All projects operate within a timeline, and delays can have financial and competitive implications. Setting realistic timelines, allocating sufficient time for each stage of the project (data collection, model training, testing, etc.), and ensuring timely delivery is vital. Additionally, the timelines should account for potential roadblocks and unforeseen complications.

4. **Regulatory Issues**: Depending on the nature of the data used and the region where the product will be deployed, different regulations may apply. This includes regulations like GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc., which dictate how user data should be handled and stored. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines and damage to the company's reputation.

5. **Data Quality and Availability**: The performance of machine learning models heavily depends on the quality and relevance of the data used for training. Ensuring data is reliable, representative, and free from bias is critical. If data is not readily available, one must consider the effort and cost associated with data acquisition, cleaning, and preprocessing.

6. **Scalability**: As the demand for the service grows, the system should be able to handle increased load without performance degradation. The infrastructure and the machine learning model itself should be designed to scale with increasing data and user load. This involves not only the ability to handle more data but also ensuring that the cost of scaling is sustainable.

7. **Security**: The system needs to be robust against potential security threats. This includes securing the data from breaches, protecting the integrity of the machine learning model, and ensuring the infrastructure is resistant to attacks. Data encryption, secure access controls, robust authentication protocols, and regular security audits are all part of this consideration.

8. **Maintainability and Monitoring**: After deployment, regular monitoring of the system is necessary to ensure it is performing as expected. This involves setting up logging, alert systems, and performance metrics. In addition, the system should be designed in a way that facilitates easy updates and maintenance without significant downtime.

9. **Integration with Existing Systems**: The new service needs to work seamlessly with existing systems. This requires consideration of API compatibility, data formats, networking, and other interoperability issues. Any incompatibility can lead to significant effort in bridging the gap or could even render the new service useless.

10. **User Acceptance**: The ultimate success of the service depends on how well it is received by its end users. User testing should be a part of the development process to ensure the service meets user needs and expectations. Feedback should be actively sought and the service should be iteratively improved based on this feedback to ensure a good user experience.
