 Intro

 • DSI team is working to aggregate data sources used by the liquidity side.

would look like.
 Whiteboard

 Personas and Data Integration
 • The goal is to map out a data integration pipeline and potential front end.
 • The exercise focuses on understanding data access patterns.
 • The aim is to understand how the back end and front end should be designed.
 • "Product Advisor" is the persona assigned to Bill and Dan.
 • Other personas may also apply.
 • Admin is a placeholder for an existing application.
 Admin Persona
 • The admin Persona can change default settings and see everything that happens.
 • It's a technology requirement to have an admin Persona.
 Other Personas
 • Team managers: Mauricio, Tim, Rob
 • Product managers: Emily and Alicia
 • Operations manager: Jared
 • Analysts: Joanna or Connor, who create reports or do research.
 Product Advisors
 • This Persona applies to Bill and Dan.
 • Participants should use the thumbs up on the post-it note to indicate this Persona 
applies to them.
 User Activities
 • Two questions:

• What do day-to-day data activities look like?
 • What should an ideal state look like?
 Data Activities
 • Preparing for calls using the liquidity sheet.
 • Accessing portfolio-level information in TAP.
 • Monitoring market rates from external sources.
 • Setting exception rates using Parachute.
 • Using Bloomberg Money Fund rate sheet.
 • Using the CNIB rate sheet.
 Updating Links
 • The CNIB rate sheet link is updated regularly due to international rate changes.
 • The intranet page handles the link changes.
 TAP and Data Manipulation
 • Bill looks at individual profiles in TAP.
 • He doesn't usually download and manipulate the data in Excel.
 Portfolio-Level Details
 • Bill uses "plus," internal info, and GCI data to look at what other banks have been doing.
 GCI Data
 • GCI data is McKinsey data.
 Pulse
 • Pulse is based on current data.
 These notes were taken with Minutes AI (https://myminutes.ai)
• It only has interest-bearing information.
 • Pulse is a user-friendly resource compared to downloading the entire portfolio from TAP.
 • The tool was built for retiering during rate cuts.
 DSI Liquidity Analytics
 • The speaker refers to the platform as "DSI Liquidity analytics," but mentions it is 
essentially a re-tiering tool.
 • The speaker wants to rename the platform.
 • The most important charts are average balance and total balances by product.
 Rate Management Tool
 • Dan and the speaker log into the rate management tool every day.
 • They want to see historical data to see what they're paying at the portfolio level and the 
offers they have in aggregate.
 • This would help them prepare for the market intel call every month.
 • They want to figure out how they're pricing similar deals, similar clients, by segment, 
industry, balance level, and elasticity.
 • They want to know what the pricing looked like on the last 10 deals that looked 
like the current deal.
 • Currently, they rely on "word of mouth and gut instinct."
 • They want to analyze the data by region.
 • Emily sent a flat file containing historical data from the rate management tool.
 • There may be a way to automate the extraction of this data and feed it into a 
dashboard.
 • Every deal is entered with the lead power ID, which reverts back to Edge.
 • Region is usually on the front page of the profile.
 Market Information
 These notes were taken with Minutes AI (https://myminutes.ai)
• The speaker uses "market information" broadly because it includes daily funding rates.
 • There is a link on SharePoint that links to other websites like the Wall Street Journal that 
have rates.
 • The speaker put the link to the market rates in the chat, which includes links to 
Bloomberg, sor, and Fed funds.
 • The speaker goes to each link manually.
 • The speaker suggests pulling information from these sources into a centralized source 
instead of linking out to them.
 • The CME is an information paywall.
 • The ALM rates (cost of funds) are on a separate screen that shows interest rate swap 
rates.
 Bloomberg Screen and Swap Data
 • Speaker mentions a Bloomberg screenshot with fallback LIBOR for adjustments but no 
swap information.
 • A link was sent with March data that updates daily with a new PDF.
 • Each day has its own file (e.g., 3/19 for today's data).
 Ideal World Automation
 • Speaker asks about automating tasks, specifically regarding the rate management tool 
and Portfolio Pulse PSI.
 • Suggestions:
 • Trending by region and segment in the rate management tool.
 • Similar information to Portfolio Pulse PSI for non-interest-bearing accounts.
 Ladder Tool Updates
 • More sweep information is being added to the ladder tool.
 • Repo sweep is next.

• Fixing rate pulling for sub-accounting.
 • Daily interest sweep, escrow agent paying agent, and non-interest-bearing 
accounts are also planned.
 Rate Management Analytics
 • Having monthly or quarterly analytics at their fingertips would be helpful for quick 
preparation before calls.
 • Weekly updates would be ideal, but monthly would be sufficient to track rate changes.
 • Monthly updates would help to ensure everything is communicated correctly.
 Implementation Plan
 • The plan is to start simple with a minimal viable product, potentially the Pulse tool.
 • The tool will be moved from the lab environment to production.
 • Initially, it may focus on the interest-bearing side.
 • Data sources will be added, followed by specialized reports for products like DACA and 
Tim's World, and trending information from the rate management tool.
 Additional Helpful Information
 • Besides the rate management tool, pipelining information from TAP or other sources 
could be helpful on sales calls.
 • Rate management tool designed to set by product, segments, and region.
 Default Deposit Level for Exception Rate Requests
 • A default deposit level for exception rate requests would be helpful.
 • The system should consider different rates paid at different deposit levels (e.g., 
$25 million vs. $200 million).
 • Currently, the rate management tool doesn't have a default deposit level for 
TMOs when requesting a rate.
 These notes were taken with Minutes AI (https://myminutes.ai)
• A separate section to include the deposit level would help track it.
 • This would allow for deposit level ranges (e.g., $2-2.5 million or $2-10 million).
 • If the deposit level is below a certain threshold (e.g., $2 million), it could 
discourage TMOs from requesting exception rates that are unlikely to be approved.
 • The deposit level feature should be implemented in the rate management tool itself, not 
just as filters or views in a dashboard.
 • TMOs would have to choose a deposit level bucket when requesting an exception.
 • The idea will be shared with Emily, who is heavily involved with the rate 
management tool.
 Enhancements to Existing Tools
 • Enhancements to existing tools like DSI, GCI, and the rate management tool would be 
incredibly helpful.
 • Consolidating information like daily large movers and market rates into one place would 
be beneficial.
 • Currently, this information is scattered across different sources on the internet.
 Next Steps
 • The team will digest the information and plan for future workshops or individual meetings 
to further understand liquidity.
 • No further questions at the moment.
