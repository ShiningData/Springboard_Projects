Business Case for the Healthcare Claim Denial Predictor Model

1. Model Objectives and Business Use Case

The Healthcare Claim Denial Predictor Model is a machine learning-based application designed to proactively identify individual service lines within healthcare claims that have a high likelihood of being denied. The model integrates seamlessly into a provider’s electronic claims submission workflow, ensuring early detection of potential denials and enabling intervention before submission to payers.

The key objectives of this model include:
	•	Reducing claim denial rates by identifying high-risk claims before submission.
	•	Enhancing revenue cycle efficiency through proactive claim review.
	•	Providing interpretability for denial predictions using RulexAI to explain why a claim might be denied.
	•	Enabling workflow automation by flagging high-risk claims and routing them to the denial management team for review.

This model is aligned with PNC’s revenue optimization strategy, allowing healthcare providers to streamline claims processing, reduce administrative burdens, and improve financial outcomes by increasing first-pass claim acceptance rates.

2. Model Design and Implementation

The model is an ensemble binary classification model, built using AutoGluon and CatBoost, to predict whether a claim service line will be denied or accepted. It leverages:
	•	837 and 835 healthcare files (both formatted flat files and X12-based files) at varying levels of aggregation and element reduction.
	•	Historical 835 adjustment codes, mapped to denote past denied claims, forming the basis for the model’s “denied” classification.
	•	Feature engineering techniques, capturing patterns in claim denials based on historical payer behavior, claim attributes, and provider-specific denial trends.

The model prediction output includes:
	•	Binary classification outcome (denied/accepted).
	•	Probability score quantifying the likelihood of denial.
	•	Local-level interpretability insights from RulexAI, explaining the key factors contributing to a denial prediction.

The model workflow:
	1.	Scans each claim submission or each claim contained in a batch file at the service-line level before submission.
	2.	Identifies high-risk claims and flags them in the provider’s submission file.
	3.	Routes flagged claims to the denial team, providing:
	•	Denial risk percentage.
	•	Potential reasons for denial.
	4.	Allows low-risk claims to proceed through the standard workflow for adjudication and payment.

3. Model Superiority Over Alternative Approaches

The ensemble approach (AutoGluon + CatBoost) significantly outperforms traditional rule-based or simpler machine learning models by:
	•	Capturing complex, non-linear relationships in claim data.
	•	Handling categorical variables efficiently, especially in healthcare claims where codes and categorical features are dominant.
	•	Reducing overfitting through automated hyperparameter tuning in AutoGluon.
	•	Providing fast, scalable predictions for real-time claim assessments.
	•	Offering explainability through RulexAI, ensuring compliance with model risk governance and interpretability standards.

Unlike traditional manual claim reviews or rule-based denial detection, this model:
	•	Adapts dynamically to changing denial patterns through ongoing model retraining.
	•	Reduces administrative costs by minimizing manual intervention.
	•	Speeds up claim submission workflows while ensuring accuracy.

4. Addressing Model Risk Issues and Outstanding MRAs

This model helps mitigate model risk concerns and addresses potential Model Risk Assessment (MRA) findings by:
	•	Providing clear interpretability using RulexAI, ensuring that model decisions are explainable.
	•	Leveraging an ensemble approach, reducing bias and variance in predictions.
	•	Incorporating diverse data sources (837 and 835 files) to enhance prediction robustness.
	•	Implementing ongoing monitoring and governance, ensuring compliance with healthcare regulatory standards and PNC’s model risk framework.

If there are existing MRAs related to previous claim denial models, this model aims to remediate those issues by:
	1.	Enhancing data coverage with a broader set of claim attributes and historical denial patterns.
	2.	Providing model transparency through SHAP values and RulexAI interpretability.
	3.	Extending the data timeline, capturing recent denial trends and payer behavior shifts.

5. Conclusion

The Claim Denial Predictor Model is a cutting-edge AI solution that enhances healthcare revenue cycle management by proactively identifying and addressing potential claim denials before submission. It leverages an ensemble-based machine learning approach (AutoGluon + CatBoost) with advanced interpretability (RulexAI) to improve prediction accuracy, reduce denials, and streamline claims processing.

This model serves as a critical component of PNC’s healthcare claims optimization strategy, ensuring that providers can maximize reimbursements, minimize rework, and improve financial performance.
