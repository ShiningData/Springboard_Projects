Subject: Re: Participation as a Coach for Model Showdown Program

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out and for considering me as a coach for the Model Showdown program. I am honored to be a part of this exciting initiative and am eager to contribute to the teams' success.

However, I will be on vacation for the first two weeks of June and will not be able to attend the coaches' orientation session scheduled for next week. If it is possible to send me the orientation materials, I will review them during my time off and be prepared to support the teams when I return.

Please let me know if this arrangement works, and I am happy to assist the teams during the competition in any way I can.

Thank you again for this opportunity.

Best regards,

Engin
