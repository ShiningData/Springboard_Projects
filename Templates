Absolutely, I concur with my colleague's sentiment. Context is a pivotal element when determining priorities. Providing clarity around why certain features or decisions are being prioritized can bridge the understanding gap, not just within the team but across various stakeholders. If the team had been made aware that the metrics feature would facilitate product review discussions, it could have shifted the perspective on its importance. This underscores the value of clear communication and the need to always align priorities with the overarching objectives of the company. When stakeholders understand the 'why' behind decisions, it fosters a collaborative environment and ensures everyone is moving in a unified direction.
