To determine if a new dish is viable for a national rollout, conducting a test is crucial. Start by selecting a representative subset of locations across diverse regions to account for customer variations. Run the test for a reasonable period, such as 4-6 weeks, to gather sufficient data.

During the test, gather customer feedback through surveys, online reviews, and direct interactions. Analyze sales data, repeat orders, and customer sentiment. Assess the dish's popularity, profit margins, and operational feasibility.

Consider the costs of running the test against potential benefits. Balancing local supply chain adjustments and training costs is important.

After the test, evaluate various factors. If the dish receives positive feedback, generates substantial sales, and aligns with the brand's identity, a national rollout could be justified. However, if results vary significantly between regions, further adaptations may be necessary.

Ultimately, a successful test reflects consistent positive customer response, sales growth, and operational viability. Adapting the dish based on regional preferences may also be necessary to ensure a successful nationwide launch.
