The `sensitivity` package in Python provides functionalities for conducting sensitivity analysis. You can use the `SensitivityAnalyzer` class from this package to analyze the sensitivity of the deposit balance to interest rate changes. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: If you haven't already installed the `sensitivity` package, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install sensitivity
```

2. **Prepare Data**: Prepare your dataset, including historical data on deposit balances and interest rates.

3. **Import SensitivityAnalyzer**: Import the `SensitivityAnalyzer` class from the `sensitivity` package.

4. **Instantiate SensitivityAnalyzer**: Create an instance of `SensitivityAnalyzer` and provide your dataset as input.

5. **Perform Sensitivity Analysis**: Use the `analyze` method of the `SensitivityAnalyzer` object to conduct sensitivity analysis for the interest rate change on deposit balance.

Here's an example of how you can conduct sensitivity analysis using the `sensitivity` package:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sensitivity import SensitivityAnalyzer

# Step 2: Prepare Data
# Assuming you have a DataFrame with historical data on deposit balances and interest rates
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Step 3: Import SensitivityAnalyzer
from sensitivity import SensitivityAnalyzer

# Step 4: Instantiate SensitivityAnalyzer
analyzer = SensitivityAnalyzer(data)

# Step 5: Perform Sensitivity Analysis
# Specify the target variable (deposit balance) and the input variable (interest rate)
target_variable = 'Deposit_Balance'
input_variable = 'Interest_Rate'

# Use the analyze method to conduct sensitivity analysis
result = analyzer.analyze(target_variable, input_variable)

# Print sensitivity indices
print("First-Order Sensitivity Index:", result['S1'])
print("Total-Order Sensitivity Index:", result['ST'])
```

In this example:
- We prepare the dataset containing historical data on deposit balances and interest rates.
- We import the `SensitivityAnalyzer` class from the `sensitivity` package.
- We instantiate a `SensitivityAnalyzer` object with our dataset.
- We specify the target variable (deposit balance) and the input variable (interest rate).
- We use the `analyze` method of the `SensitivityAnalyzer` object to conduct sensitivity analysis for the interest rate change on deposit balance.
- Finally, we print the sensitivity indices, such as the first-order and total-order sensitivity indices, obtained from the analysis.

To plot a dot-like graph showing the outcome data of all scenarios from the sensitivity analysis, you can use libraries such as Matplotlib. Here's how you can modify the previous code snippet to include plotting:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sensitivity import SensitivityAnalyzer
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 2: Prepare Data
# Assuming you have a DataFrame with historical data on deposit balances and interest rates
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Step 3: Import SensitivityAnalyzer
from sensitivity import SensitivityAnalyzer

# Step 4: Instantiate SensitivityAnalyzer
analyzer = SensitivityAnalyzer(data)

# Step 5: Perform Sensitivity Analysis
# Specify the target variable (deposit balance) and the input variable (interest rate)
target_variable = 'Deposit_Balance'
input_variable = 'Interest_Rate'

# Use the analyze method to conduct sensitivity analysis
result = analyzer.analyze(target_variable, input_variable)

# Plot the dot-like graph
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(analyzer.input_data[input_variable], analyzer.output_data[target_variable], 'bo', label='Data Points')
plt.xlabel(input_variable)
plt.ylabel(target_variable)
plt.title('Sensitivity Analysis: Deposit Balance vs. Interest Rate')
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

In this code snippet:
- We import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` to plot the graph.
- After conducting sensitivity analysis using the `SensitivityAnalyzer`, we plot the outcome data points (`Deposit_Balance` vs. `Interest_Rate`) as blue dots (`'bo'`).
- We set appropriate labels, title, and legend for the plot.
- Finally, we display the plot using `plt.show()`.

Certainly! The `sensitivity` package provides a table with the result values, including the first-order sensitivity index (`S1`) and total-order sensitivity index (`ST`). You can access this table directly from the `result` variable obtained after conducting sensitivity analysis. Here's how you can write Python code to display this table:

```python
# Display the sensitivity analysis results table
print("Sensitivity Analysis Results:")
print(result.table)
```

This code will print the sensitivity analysis results table, which includes the first-order sensitivity index (`S1`) and total-order sensitivity index (`ST`) for each scenario. You can directly print or format this table as per your requirements.
