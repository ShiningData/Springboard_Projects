Subject: Annual Review Update: MRMG Documentation Review - Input Required

Hello,

I have completed reviewing all submitted documents for the Annual MRMG assessment and have summarized the areas where I need your input in the attached document:

For Amanda/Jerry:
 Pages 4-5: Are there additional model versioning and change logs for 2021-2022 that should be included in the document?
 Pages 6-7: Do you have any updates regarding Model Business Objectives, Uses, Risks, Downstream Impacts, Scope, Exposure, or Output Governance?
 Pages 8-9: We will be using only FMOL and Grady 835/837 data with RDC_yes files to engineer target variables in our model. Previously used CMS and Scraped Service code hierarchies will not be included. I will update the document accordingly.
 Page 16: Should we maintain the current operational workflow section as is?
 Page 21: Is the current model risk assessment approach still appropriate?

For Anjaneyulu:
 Pages 4-5: Are there any other model versioning and change logs from 2021-2022 that need to be incorporated?
 Pages 10-12: Is the data validation process still accurate as described?
 Could you clarify the input data validation process with the new API requirements?

For Sundeep/Anjaneyulu:
 Page 19: Please provide input on the model monitoring and performance benchmark approach. Should we maintain the current monitoring metrics?

I have scheduled time to discuss your feedback on the items above. Your collaboration is greatly appreciated as we work to complete this annual MRMG review process.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
