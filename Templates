Sure, here's a plan for Sprint 1 of the churn model dashboard development:

**Sprint 1 Focus:**
The focus of Sprint 1 is to establish the foundational components for the churn model dashboard, ensuring the main page's functionality, design, and user interactions are in place. This sprint will lay the groundwork for subsequent feature development and create a solid base for user testing and feedback.

**Sprint Plan:**
1. **Ticket 1 - Data Pipeline Setup (Size: 2):** Implement the data pipeline to extract and integrate data from various sources into the dashboard, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

2. **Ticket 2 - User Authentication (Size: 1):** Develop user authentication functionality to secure the dashboard and ensure authorized access for users.

3. **Ticket 3 - Main Page UI Design (Size: 2):** Design the user interface for the main page, including layout, visual elements, and data visualization placeholders.

4. **Ticket 4 - Churn Analysis Backend (Size: 2):** Develop backend logic to perform churn analysis on the provided data and generate relevant insights.

5. **Ticket 5 - Churn Causes/Recommendations Display (Size: 1):** Implement the display of churn causes and recommendations based on the churn analysis results.

6. **Ticket 6 - Top Churn Risk Customer List (Size: 1):** Create a dynamic list of top customers at risk of churn, based on the churn analysis data.

7. **Ticket 7 - User Engagement Tracking (Size: 1):** Set up user engagement tracking mechanisms to monitor user interactions with the dashboard.

8. **Ticket 8 - Unit Testing (Size: 1):** Write and execute unit tests for the developed components to ensure their functionality and reliability.

**Backlog (Not Prioritized for Sprint 1):**
1. **Ticket 9 - Second Page UI Design (Size: 2):** Design the user interface for the second page, focusing on interactive graphs illustrating churn impact on revenue and retention.

2. **Ticket 10 - Last Page Structure (Size: 1):** Define the structure and layout of the last page that will display churn prediction model details.

**Explanation:**
The focus of Sprint 1 is to establish a solid foundation by addressing key components of the dashboard. By setting up the data pipeline, user authentication, and the core functionalities of the main page, we ensure that the dashboard can handle data and user interactions effectively. This approach also aligns with the prioritized features outlined in the initial product roadmap. Establishing these foundational elements early will allow for more efficient development in subsequent sprints and enable user testing to begin as soon as possible.
