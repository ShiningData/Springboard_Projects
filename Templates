Conduct sensitivity analysis for the interest rate change on deposit balance as stated below:Response Surface Methodology (RSM):
Fit a response surface model to the relationship between interest rate changes and deposit balances.
Use the fitted model to predict deposit balances for different interest rate scenarios and assess the sensitivity of the model's predictions.
Python libraries such as scikit-learn or statsmodels can be used for fitting response surface models.

To conduct sensitivity analysis for the impact of interest rate changes on deposit balances using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), you can fit a response surface model to the relationship between interest rate changes and deposit balances. Here's how you can do it using scikit-learn:

1. **Load Data**: Load the dataset containing deposit balance and interest rate data.

2. **Prepare Data**: Prepare the data by splitting it into features (interest rate changes) and target variable (deposit balances).

3. **Fit Response Surface Model**: Use scikit-learn or statsmodels to fit a response surface model to the relationship between interest rate changes and deposit balances.

4. **Predict Deposit Balances**: Use the fitted model to predict deposit balances for different interest rate scenarios.

5. **Analyze Sensitivity**: Analyze the predicted deposit balances for different interest rate scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the model's predictions.

Here's an example of how you can conduct sensitivity analysis using Response Surface Methodology in Python with scikit-learn:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Load dataset (assuming you have a CSV file with deposit balance and interest rate data)
data = pd.read_csv('deposit_data.csv')

# Prepare data
X = data[['Interest_Rate']]  # Features (interest rate changes)
y = data['Deposit_Balance']  # Target variable (deposit balances)

# Fit Response Surface Model
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)  # Use polynomial features up to degree 2
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)  # Transform features to polynomial features
model = LinearRegression().fit(X_poly, y)  # Fit linear regression model

# Predict Deposit Balances for Different Interest Rate Scenarios
# Define interest rate scenarios (e.g., increase by 0.25%, decrease by 0.25%, no change)
interest_rate_scenarios = np.array([[0.0025], [-0.0025], [0]])  # Example scenarios
X_poly_scenarios = poly.transform(interest_rate_scenarios)  # Transform scenarios to polynomial features
predicted_deposit_balances = model.predict(X_poly_scenarios)  # Predict deposit balances

# Analyze Sensitivity
print("Predicted Deposit Balances for Different Interest Rate Scenarios:")
for i, scenario in enumerate(interest_rate_scenarios):
    print(f"Scenario {i+1}: Interest Rate Change = {scenario[0] * 100}%")
    print(f"Predicted Deposit Balance: {predicted_deposit_balances[i]}")
    print()
```

In this example:
- We load the dataset containing deposit balance and interest rate data.
- We split the data into features (interest rate changes) and target variable (deposit balances).
- We fit a response surface model to the relationship between interest rate changes and deposit balances using polynomial regression.
- We use the fitted model to predict deposit balances for different interest rate scenarios (e.g., increase by 0.25%, decrease by 0.25%, no change).
- We analyze the predicted deposit balances for different interest rate scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the model's predictions.
