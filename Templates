Model Uses

Use 1: Healthcare Claim Denial Prediction

The Healthcare Claim Denial Predictor Model is designed to proactively identify individual service lines within healthcare claims that have a high likelihood of being denied. The model integrates into a provider’s electronic claims submission workflow, ensuring early detection of potential denials and enabling intervention before submission to payers.

This model is used within healthcare revenue cycle management to reduce claim denial rates, improve claims processing efficiency, and optimize revenue recovery. The model’s output informs denial management teams, allowing them to address claim issues before submission to clearinghouses and insurance carriers.

Prerequisites and Workflow:
	1.	Input Data Sources:
	•	837 and 835 healthcare files, including flat file and X12-based formats at different levels of aggregation and element reduction.
	•	Historical 835 adjustment codes, mapped to denote past denied claims, serving as the basis for denial classification.
	2.	Model Processing and Decision Logic:
	•	The machine learning model (ensemble of AutoGluon and CatBoost) evaluates each claim service line prior to submission.
	•	It generates a binary classification output (denied/accepted), a denial probability score, and interpretability insights using RulexAI.
	•	Claims with a high probability of denial are flagged and routed to the denial management team for review, along with:
	•	Denial risk percentage
	•	Potential reasons for denial
	3.	Final Action:
	•	Low-risk claims proceed through the standard adjudication workflow for payment.
	•	High-risk claims are intercepted before submission and reviewed by the denial management team, helping prevent unnecessary revenue loss.

Justification for Model Use

Traditional rule-based claim validation systems are static and often fail to adapt to changing payer policies. This model provides a data-driven, adaptive solution that:
	•	Dynamically identifies denial risk using historical claim patterns.
	•	Reduces manual review workload by automatically flagging high-risk claims.
	•	Enhances claim processing efficiency by improving first-pass acceptance rates.
	•	Provides interpretable denial risk insights using RulexAI, ensuring transparency in decision-making.

Given the complexity and variability in claim denial trends, a machine learning model is the optimal approach for predicting high-risk claims. The model utilizes historical denial data, payer-specific patterns, and claim attributes, ensuring robust and accurate predictions.

Model Governance and Approval

The model requirements have been reviewed and approved by PNC’s Healthcare Analytics and Model Risk Management (MRM) teams. The model undergoes continuous monitoring and validation to ensure compliance with industry regulations and PNC’s internal governance framework.
