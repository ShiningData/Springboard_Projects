I couldn't agree more with the perspective shared. While a consumer-centric approach is undoubtedly essential for product success, the well-being and morale of employees play an equally critical role. Employees are the backbone of any organization, and ensuring they are motivated, engaged, and aligned with the company's goals can significantly boost product outcomes. By setting realistic metrics, we not only set achievable targets but also instill a sense of purpose and achievement among the staff. A holistic approach, where both consumer needs and employee welfare are prioritized, creates a sustainable growth model for the company. This dual focus is what will distinguish us in the market and ensure long-term success.
