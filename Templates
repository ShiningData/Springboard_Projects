Conduct sensitivity analysis for the interest rate change on deposit balance via Counterfactual Analaysis in python as stated below:
Counterfactual Analysis:
Conduct counterfactual analysis to estimate what deposit balances would have been under alternative interest rate scenarios.
Use econometric or machine learning models to simulate the hypothetical outcomes of deposit balances under different interest rate conditions.
Compare the actual deposit balances with the counterfactual outcomes to assess the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes.
