Thank you for providing the Sprint 1 plan. Based on this, I will now help you write a user story for one of the tickets, specifically "Ticket 3 - Main Page UI Design." 

**User Story for Ticket 3: Main Page UI Design**
As a user, I would like to have an intuitive and visually appealing user interface (UI) design on the main page of the churn model dashboard, so that I can easily understand the churn analysis insights and make informed decisions to reduce customer churn.

**Description:**
The main page of the churn model dashboard serves as the initial point of interaction for users seeking insights into customer churn. By focusing on an intuitive and visually appealing UI design, users can have a seamless experience navigating the dashboard and comprehending the churn analysis data. The design should incorporate clear layout structures, interactive elements, and placeholders for data visualizations that effectively communicate churn risks and insights. This user-friendly design will empower users, including marketing and customer retention teams, to quickly identify potential churn risks and prioritize their efforts to retain valuable customers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The UI design follows the established design guidelines and maintains consistency with the product's overall visual identity.
- The main page layout is organized logically, presenting key information such as churn analysis, churn causes/recommendations, and the top customer list.
- Visual elements, including fonts, colors, icons, and buttons, are chosen thoughtfully to enhance readability and user engagement.
- Placeholder sections are created for future integration of data visualizations, ensuring a clear and well-structured presentation of churn insights.
- The design is responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience.
- Feedback from the design team and relevant stakeholders is gathered and incorporated to refine the UI design.

By focusing on delivering a user-centric and visually engaging UI design for the main page, users will be empowered to gain valuable insights into customer churn and take proactive steps to improve customer retention rates.
