When creating this product roadmap, I used a thorough evaluation of the projects based on ten essential factors. The factors range from financial and engineering costs, time-based risks, regulatory issues, to user acceptance. Each project was evaluated on a scale of 'Small', 'Medium', 'Large', or 'Not Applicable'. This detailed evaluation allowed us to effectively gauge each project's needs, risks, and impacts, making the roadmap's creation more precise and well-informed.

Project A and B, falling under back-end improvements, were started first due to their substantial scale in several evaluation areas, signaling a higher need for time and resources. These projects also support the foundational aspects of the product, making them critical to be prioritized. Given their large scale, they account for 56% of the effort, as represented in the pie chart. Project B, having more 'Large' evaluations, was completed in two quarters as opposed to Project A's three quarters to accelerate its completion due to its high demand in resources and potential impact.

Project E, the front-end improvement, and projects C and D from the research and development category, are scheduled later. These projects have less intense demands across the evaluated factors and can capitalize on the improved backend, ensuring seamless integration and efficient utilization of resources. Notably, Project E starts after the completion of Project B, allowing the front-end improvements to immediately build upon the finalized backend. 

As for the pie chart, it depicts that the back-end improvements, being the most resource-intensive, claim the largest portion of the overall effort. In contrast, front-end improvements and research & development projects, having a less extensive demand in most factors, share an equal but smaller portion of the effort. 

In conclusion, this roadmap strategy makes necessary trade-offs to balance the requirements and potential impacts of each project. The sequence and timing of the projects ensure that the foundational aspects are enhanced first, which subsequent projects can build upon, leading to efficient resource allocation and potentially more effective product improvements. The approach aligns with our understanding of each project's requirements and complexity and sets the stage for a structured and impactful development cycle.
