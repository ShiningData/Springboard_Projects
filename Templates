Subject: Update on Model Output Labels

Dear MRMG Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to inform you about a recent update we received from our client concerning the model we sent for review.

While the content and significance of the model output labels remain unchanged, the client has decided to rename some of these labels for clarity or internal consistency. It is important to note that these modifications will not impact the way the model runs, as they are purely cosmetic and pertain only to the naming convention of the outputs.

Here's a summary of the changes:

**Old Label** -> **New Label**
1. OldLabel1 -> NewLabel1
2. OldLabel2 -> NewLabel2
3. OldLabel3 -> NewLabel3
(Continue the list as needed)

These changes will be integrated into all subsequent model documentation and reports. I wanted to make sure you were aware of this adjustment so that there's no confusion moving forward.

Please let me know if you have any questions or require further clarification on this matter.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,
