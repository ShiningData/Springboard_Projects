Thank you for reaching out. I have compiled the training/testing data, notebooks covering the data ingestion, processing, engineering, and modeling pipeline into a single repository. This repository has been zipped and is now available on our SharePoint.

You can access all these resources through the following SharePoint link: [SharePoint Link]. Additionally, you'll find the model pipeline slide and performance metrics slide within the same repository for a comprehensive overview.

As the point of contact for this task, I’m at your disposal to walk you through the resources and the model itself. Please feel free to schedule a meeting as per your convenience; my calendar is up to date. I’m confident that a discussion will help clarify any queries you have regarding the model refit and operation with synthetic data.

Looking forward to our collaboration.
