These inaccuracies might precipitate premature or delayed financial actions such as improper withdrawal of funds from liquidity accounts, leading to financial strain or lost investment opportunities. Moreover, imprecise forecasts could result in inadequate staffing levels, affecting customer service quality. To mitigate such risks, a rigorous backtesting protocol is in place, ensuring robust model validation and performance tuning. Users are also systematically briefed on the associated risks, reinforcing our commitment to transparency and continuous improvement in our forecasting capabilities.
