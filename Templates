we propose an end-to-end text recognition approach with pre-trained image Transformer and text Transformer models, namely TrOCR, which leverages the Transformer architecture for both image understanding and wordpiece-level text generation. The TrOCR model is simple but effective, and can be pre-trained with large-scale synthetic data and fine-tuned with human-labeled datasets. Experiments show that the TrOCR model outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on both printed and handwritten text recognition tasks.

TrOCR is pre-trained in 2 stages before being fine-tuned on downstream datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art results on both printed (e.g. the SROIE dataset and handwritten (e.g. the IAM Handwriting dataset text recognition tasks. For more information, see the official models.
TrOCR is always used within the VisionEncoderDecoder framework.

TrOCR, or Transformational OCR, is a cutting-edge Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology that utilizes advanced deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to recognize and extract text from images. TrOCR is designed to handle a variety of text styles, including handwritten and typed text, making it suitable for tasks like extracting text from bank check images where the text can vary in style and format.

**Pros of using TrOCR:**

1. **High Accuracy:** TrOCR leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, which often results in high accuracy in recognizing both handwritten and typed text. This makes it suitable for applications where precision is crucial, such as processing financial documents like bank checks.

2. **Versatility:** TrOCR is designed to handle a wide range of text styles and languages, making it versatile for different applications and use cases. It can adapt to variations in handwriting styles and fonts commonly found on bank checks.

3. **Deep Learning Capabilities:** The deep learning models used in TrOCR are capable of learning complex patterns and features from images, enabling them to recognize text even in challenging conditions such as poor lighting, skewed angles, or low-resolution images.

4. **Customization:** Depending on the specific requirements of the task, TrOCR can be fine-tuned or customized to improve performance on particular types of text or domains. This flexibility allows for optimization to achieve the best possible results for extracting text from bank check images.

5. **Scalability:** TrOCR can be deployed at scale to process large volumes of images efficiently, making it suitable for processing a high volume of bank checks in a timely manner.

**Cons of using TrOCR:**

1. **Training Data Requirements:** Achieving high accuracy with TrOCR typically requires a substantial amount of labeled training data, particularly for tasks involving handwritten text recognition. Gathering and annotating such data can be time-consuming and costly.

2. **Computational Resources:** Training and deploying deep learning models like those used in TrOCR may require significant computational resources, including powerful GPUs or TPUs. This can add to the infrastructure costs associated with implementing TrOCR in a production environment.

3. **Performance Degradation with Poor Quality Images:** While TrOCR is robust to certain variations in text styles and image conditions, its performance may degrade significantly when dealing with extremely poor quality images or highly degraded text. Pre-processing steps may be necessary to improve the quality of input images for optimal performance.

4. **Maintenance and Updates:** Like any deep learning-based system, TrOCR may require ongoing maintenance and updates to stay effective as new techniques and advancements emerge in the field of OCR. This includes updating the models, fine-tuning parameters, and adapting to changes in the data distribution.

Overall, TrOCR offers a powerful solution for extracting text from bank check images, especially when dealing with a mix of handwritten and typed text. However, it's essential to consider the associated challenges and requirements, such as data preparation, computational resources, and ongoing maintenance, when deciding to implement TrOCR for a particular application.
