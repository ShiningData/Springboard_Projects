Subject: MRMG Meeting Follow-Up and Request for Assistance on Remaining Questions

Hi [Product Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to express my gratitude for your assistance during the recent MRMG meeting. Your knowledge and input greatly contributed to the smooth running of the meeting and I truly appreciate your support.

We have a few outstanding items from the meeting, specifically, a document that requires our collective contributions. I have managed to address two of the questions that were more aligned with my technical expertise and data modeling know-how. However, the remaining three questions are more business-oriented, and I believe your insights would be extremely beneficial in providing well-rounded answers.

I've highlighted these questions in yellow in the document for easy reference. Additionally, I would greatly appreciate if you could also review the answers I've drafted for the technical and data-related questions to ensure they align with our business context and objectives.

I look forward to your valuable contributions and insights, and I am confident that together we can craft comprehensive responses that will be beneficial to all team members. 

Thank you again for your ongoing support and collaboration. 

Best,
[Your Name]
