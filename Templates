Conduct sensitivity analysis on interest rate change on deposit balance via agent-based modeling (ABM) in python as stated below:
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM):
Implement agent-based models to simulate the behavior of individual bank customers in response to interest rate changes.
Analyze emergent patterns and aggregate outcomes to understand the system-level sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate fluctuations.
Python libraries like Mesa offer frameworks for building agent-based models.

To conduct sensitivity analysis on the impact of interest rate changes on deposit balance using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) in Python, you can use the `Mesa` library. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: If you haven't already installed `Mesa`, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install mesa
```

2. **Implement Agent-Based Model**: Define an agent-based model to simulate the behavior of individual bank customers in response to interest rate changes. Each agent represents a bank customer and has attributes and behaviors that govern their decision-making process regarding deposit balances.

3. **Simulate Interest Rate Changes**: Implement mechanisms to simulate interest rate changes within the agent-based model. This could involve defining rules for how interest rates change over time or incorporating external factors that influence interest rates.

4. **Analyze Aggregate Outcomes**: Run multiple simulations of the agent-based model with varying interest rate scenarios and analyze the aggregate outcomes, such as total deposit balances across all agents, to understand the system-level sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate fluctuations.

Here's a basic example of how you can conduct sensitivity analysis using Agent-Based Modeling in Python with the `Mesa` library:

```python
from mesa import Agent, Model
from mesa.time import RandomActivation
from mesa.space import MultiGrid
from mesa.datacollection import DataCollector
import random

# Define Agent class
class BankCustomer(Agent):
    def __init__(self, unique_id, model):
        super().__init__(unique_id, model)
        self.deposit_balance = random.uniform(1000, 2000)  # Initial deposit balance

    def step(self):
        # Define agent behavior in response to interest rate changes
        # Example: Agent decides whether to adjust deposit balance based on interest rate
        if self.model.interest_rate > 0.05:
            self.deposit_balance += random.uniform(0, 100)
        elif self.model.interest_rate < 0.02:
            self.deposit_balance -= random.uniform(0, 100)

# Define Model class
class BankModel(Model):
    def __init__(self, N, interest_rate):
        self.num_agents = N
        self.interest_rate = interest_rate
        self.schedule = RandomActivation(self)
        self.grid = MultiGrid(1, N, True)

        # Create agents
        for i in range(self.num_agents):
            a = BankCustomer(i, self)
            self.schedule.add(a)
            x = 0
            y = i
            self.grid.place_agent(a, (x, y))

        # Data collector to track aggregate outcomes
        self.datacollector = DataCollector(
            agent_reporters={"Deposit_Balance": lambda a: a.deposit_balance})

    def step(self):
        self.datacollector.collect(self)
        self.schedule.step()

# Run simulations with different interest rate scenarios
for interest_rate in [0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05]:
    model = BankModel(1000, interest_rate)
    for i in range(100):
        model.step()

    # Analyze aggregate outcomes
    # Example: Calculate mean deposit balance across all agents
    all_agent_balances = model.datacollector.get_agent_vars_dataframe()
    mean_deposit_balance = all_agent_balances.mean()
    print(f"Mean Deposit Balance with Interest Rate {interest_rate}: {mean_deposit_balance}")
```

In this example:
- We define an Agent class (`BankCustomer`) to represent individual bank customers. Each agent has an initial deposit balance and a behavior that may adjust the balance in response to interest rate changes.
- We define a Model class (`BankModel`) that creates a specified number of agents and simulates their behavior over time.
- We run multiple simulations with different interest rate scenarios and analyze aggregate outcomes, such as mean deposit balance across all agents, to understand the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate fluctuations.
