*Title: Enhance Bank Name Mapping for Money Movements Analysis*

*Overview:*
This update introduces a refined mapping of financial institution names through a combination of functions and dictionaries, optimizing the bank name feature within our Money Movements and payment trends analysis. The objective is to streamline our routing number to bank names mapping process, ensuring repeatability and accuracy.

*Modifications:*

- Developed bank_name_map_func, which pre-processes financial institution names for consistency.
- Introduced bank_name_map_dict, employing a dictionary to standardize financial institution names to a unique, formatted identifier for each entity.
- Crafted bank_name_map_main, utilizing the function and dictionary to process ACH and wire transaction tables, establish a usa_ca_flag, and generate the definitive table for lab utilization.

*File Updates:*
- *README*: Documentation has been updated to reflect new functionality.
- *SLURM*: Enhanced, if applicable to incorporate the updated job scheduling mechanism.
- *Lab Tables*: Revised to integrate the updated bank mapping logic.
