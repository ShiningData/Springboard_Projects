Conduct sensitivity analysis on  interest rate change on deposit balance via Granger Causality Analysis in python as stated below: 
Granger Causality Analysis:
Conduct Granger causality tests to investigate the causal relationship between interest rate changes and deposit balances over time.
Analyze whether past changes in interest rates predict future changes in deposit balances, and vice versa.
The statsmodels package in Python provides functions for Granger causality testing.

To conduct sensitivity analysis on the impact of interest rate changes on deposit balance using Granger Causality Analysis in Python, you can use the `statsmodels` package. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: If you haven't already installed `statsmodels`, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install statsmodels
```

2. **Prepare Data**: Prepare your time series data for Granger causality testing, ensuring that you have both interest rate changes and deposit balances over time.

3. **Perform Granger Causality Test**: Use the `Granger causality test` function from the `statsmodels` package to test the causal relationship between interest rate changes and deposit balances over time.

4. **Analyze Sensitivity**: Analyze the results of the Granger causality test to understand whether past changes in interest rates predict future changes in deposit balances, and vice versa.

Here's a basic example of how you can conduct sensitivity analysis using Granger Causality Analysis in Python with the `statsmodels` package:

```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import grangercausalitytests

# Load dataset (assuming you have a DataFrame with time series data)
data = pd.read_csv('time_series_data.csv', parse_dates=['Date'], index_col='Date')

# Extract interest rate changes and deposit balances
interest_rate_changes = data['Interest_Rate']
deposit_balances = data['Deposit_Balance']

# Perform Granger Causality Test
max_lag = 3  # Maximum lag to consider
test_results = grangercausalitytests(data[['Deposit_Balance', 'Interest_Rate']], max_lag, verbose=True)

# Analyze Sensitivity
# Inspect the test results to understand the causal relationship between interest rate changes and deposit balances
```

In this example:
- We load the time series data containing interest rate changes and deposit balances over time.
- We extract interest rate changes and deposit balances from the dataset.
- We perform the Granger Causality Test using the `grangercausalitytests` function from `statsmodels`, considering up to a maximum lag of 3.
- We analyze the test results to understand whether past changes in interest rates predict future changes in deposit balances, and vice versa. The results will include statistical significance levels and F-statistics for each lag, indicating the presence of causality.
