To conduct a sensitivity analysis for interest rate changes on deposit balances in Python by Partial Dependency Plots as stated below using python:
Visualize the relationship between interest rate changes and deposit balances while marginalizing over other variables.
Partial dependency plots illustrate how deposit balances change as interest rates vary, holding other variables constant at their mean or median values.
Tools like scikit-learn or the PDPbox library in Python can generate partial dependency plots.

To conduct sensitivity analysis for interest rate changes on deposit balances using Partial Dependency Plots (PDP) in Python, you can use the PDPbox library along with scikit-learn for modeling. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Load Data**: Load the dataset containing deposit balance and other relevant variables such as customer demographics.

2. **Prepare Data**: Prepare the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting it into features (including interest rate changes) and target variable (deposit balances).

3. **Fit a Model**: Fit a machine learning model to the data. For this example, you can use a regression model like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.

4. **Generate Partial Dependency Plots**: Use the PDPbox library to generate partial dependency plots for the interest rate variable while marginalizing over other variables.

5. **Visualize Results**: Visualize the partial dependency plots to understand how deposit balances change as interest rates vary, while holding other variables constant at their mean or median values.

Here's an example of how you can conduct sensitivity analysis using Partial Dependency Plots in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from pdpbox import pdp, info_plots
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset (assuming you have a CSV file with deposit balance and other variables)
data = pd.read_csv('deposit_data.csv')

# Handle missing values and encode categorical variables (if needed)

# Split data into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = data.drop(columns=['Deposit_Balance'])  # Features
y = data['Deposit_Balance']  # Target variable

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Fit a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) to the training data
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Generate Partial Dependency Plots for interest rate variable
interest_rate_pdp = pdp.pdp_isolate(model=model, dataset=X_test, model_features=X.columns, feature='Interest_Rate')

# Visualize Partial Dependency Plot for interest rate variable
pdp.pdp_plot(interest_rate_pdp, 'Interest Rate')
plt.xlabel('Interest Rate')
plt.ylabel('Partial Dependency')
plt.title('Partial Dependency Plot for Interest Rate on Deposit Balance')
plt.show()
```

In this example:
- We load the dataset containing deposit balance and other relevant variables.
- We split the data into features (X) and target variable (y).
- We fit a Random Forest regression model to the training data.
- We use the PDPbox library to generate a partial dependency plot for the interest rate variable, while marginalizing over other variables.
- We visualize the partial dependency plot to understand how deposit balances change as interest rates vary, holding other variables constant at their mean or median values.

You can repeat this process for other variables of interest to conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis.
