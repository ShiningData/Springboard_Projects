**Question-2: You added Apple Pay. However, you don't have enough data to know if the feature was impactful. You doubled the website visitors who register for an account from 1% to 2%, but you do not know yet which users have Apple devices. That means you can't measure if users with Apple devices (the only ones impacted by Apple Pay) are more likely, or just as likely to upgrade as they were before. What should you do now? Continue adding other payment features, remove Apple Pay, Keep the features and move on, or gather more data (if so, what data and what would you like to do with it?) Why?**

Given the current situation and the limited data available, the recommended approach is to gather more data before making any further decisions about Apple Pay. Making decisions based on incomplete data could lead to incorrect conclusions and ineffective strategies. It's important to have a clear understanding of the impact of Apple Pay on user behavior before proceeding.

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Gather Data on Apple Device Users:** Implement tracking mechanisms to identify users who are using Apple devices and those who are potentially impacted by Apple Pay. This might involve collecting user device information during the registration process or through user profiles.
2. **Data Segmentation:** Once you have identified Apple device users, segment them from the rest of the user base. This will allow you to analyze the behavior of this specific group separately.
3. **Track User Behavior:** Monitor the behavior of Apple device users after registration. Specifically, focus on their interaction with premium features, upgrade rates, and any changes in their behavior compared to the pre-Apple Pay period.
4. **Analyze and Compare:** Compare the upgrade rates of Apple device users before and after the implementation of Apple Pay. Determine whether there is a noticeable change in their likelihood to upgrade.
5. **Iterative Decision-Making:** Based on the analysis, if there's evidence that Apple Pay positively impacted the upgrade rates of Apple device users, you can consider keeping the feature and possibly continue exploring other payment features. If the impact is negligible or negative, you might need to reevaluate the inclusion of Apple Pay.

**Reasoning:**
Gathering more data is crucial in making informed decisions. While doubling the registration rate is a positive sign, it's essential to understand how Apple Pay specifically affects user behavior. If Apple Pay isn't impacting user behavior as expected, simply continuing to add other payment features might not lead to the desired outcomes. By analyzing the data from Apple device users, you can make an informed decision about the effectiveness of Apple Pay and whether it should be retained, improved, or removed. Making decisions based on data helps ensure that product strategies are aligned with user needs and behaviors.
