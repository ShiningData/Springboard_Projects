You're right, let me revise the model summary to accurately reflect that it's a binary classification model:

## Introduction

This is a machine learning application that will identify when an individual service line of a healthcare claim has a likelihood of becoming denied. The data used for this predictor consists of an ensemble model combining AUTOGLUON and Catboost algorithms trained on 837 and 835 Healthcare files (formatted flat files or X12-based) in different formats/levels of aggregation/element reduction. The predicted "denied" classification is based off of a historical mapping of 835 adjustment codes that were considered denials.

The healthcare claim denial predictor algorithm was created to be added into a provider's electronic claims submission workflow where it would have the ability to identify claims with a high risk of denial. The denial predictor algorithm will "scan" each claim submission or each claim contained in a batch file by service line prior to the file being sent to a clearinghouse and/or insurance carrier for adjudication and payment. If the 837 service line data is evaluated and deemed likely to be paid it will proceed through the provider's typical claim workflow process. If the 837 service line data is identified as a potential denial the claim will be "flagged" from the initial submission file and rerouted back to the claim's denial team accompanied with denial risk percentage and potential reasons for denial.

## Model Summary

We have implemented an ensemble machine learning solution for this purpose. This is a binary classification model which combines two robust well-performing algorithms (AUTOGLUON and Catboost) to predict whether a claim will be denied or paid. The model outputs a denial risk probability score for each service line, with higher scores indicating greater likelihood of denial.

The output of this model is a binary classification result (denied/paid) along with a probability score that quantifies the confidence level of the prediction. Claims with high denial probability are flagged and routed to the denial team for review before submission, allowing for proactive intervention to reduce denial rates and improve revenue cycleÂ efficiency.
