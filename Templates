Senior Data Scientist / DSI Team

1. KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS
a. Claim Predictor Project:
I led the Claim Predictor Project, an innovative initiative aimed at streamlining and enhancing claim preprocessing by identifying potential claim denials before submission. This solution addresses critical challenges in the healthcare claims process, such as reducing administrative costs, decreasing denial rates, and improving cash flow efficiency. By proactively flagging potential denials, the model enables providers to address issues early and expedite payment cycles. Key accomplishments include:
(1)	Analyzing and Addressing Legacy Shortcomings: I conducted an in-depth analysis of the previous model, which business stakeholders found unsatisfactory, codebase, workflow, data implementation, and MRMG documentation. Through ad hoc data analysis and close collaboration with business partners, I identified key areas for improvement and delivered actionable recommendations.
(2)	Developing a High-Performance Ensemble Model: Leveraging insights gained from stakeholder collaboration, I spearheaded the development of an ensemble model utilizing AutoML and CatBoost. The new model outperformed its predecessor in both performance metrics and interpretability, meeting business expectations and offering a more robust solution.
