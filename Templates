The **Bank Account Authentication Model** is designed to enhance transaction security by introducing an additional layer of verification—validating the recipient’s account ownership. This model employs a **rule-based approach** to verify **Account Owner Authentication (AOA)** data by cross-referencing beneficiary account details against an authoritative data source, **Early Warning Services (EWS)**. By matching key identifiers such as **name, Social Security Number (SSN), date of birth (DOB), ID, phone number, and address**, the model mitigates risks associated with improper or fraudulent payments.  

To ensure **better explainability** and **improve data labeling** for future enhancements, we have initially adopted a **rule-based system**. This approach allows for a structured validation process while facilitating the transition to a **Machine Learning (ML) model**, which we plan to implement in the future to achieve **sustainable, long-term benefits**.  

As an enhancement to this model, we propose **reducing API calls** by leveraging the **PNC Payment Network** to verify the availability of beneficiary accounts. Under this enhancement, the account owner will submit beneficiary account details to the PNC Payment Network. If the account exists within the network, a response will be directly returned to the user, eliminating the need for an external API call and reducing costs. If the account is not found in the network, an API request will be sent to EWS, and PNC will receive, parse, and process the returned data before providing a response to the user. This enhancement is expected to reduce API request costs by approximately **30%**, significantly optimizing operational expenses.  

Business stakeholders are actively addressing **legal and regulatory challenges** associated with this implementation. They remain optimistic about overcoming these obstacles and are targeting a **go-live date in Q2**, with **May as the earliest possible launch window**.
