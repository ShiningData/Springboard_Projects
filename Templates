Conduct sensitivity analysis on interest rates on deposit balance via econometric time series models approach as stated below:
Econometric Time Series Models:
Utilize econometric time series models such as Vector Autoregression (VAR) or Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to analyze the dynamic relationship between interest rates and deposit balances.
Estimate impulse response functions to quantify the short-term and long-term effects of interest rate shocks on deposit balances.
Python packages like statsmodels offer implementations of VAR and VECM models.

To conduct sensitivity analysis on the impact of interest rates on deposit balance using econometric time series models like Vector Autoregression (VAR) or Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) in Python, you can use the `statsmodels` package. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: If you haven't already installed `statsmodels`, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install statsmodels
```

2. **Prepare Data**: Prepare your time series data for analysis, ensuring that you have both interest rates and deposit balances over time.

3. **Estimate VAR or VECM Model**: Estimate a VAR or VECM model using the `VAR` or `VECM` class from `statsmodels`.

4. **Analyze Impulse Response Functions**: Use the estimated model to analyze impulse response functions, which quantify the short-term and long-term effects of interest rate shocks on deposit balances.

Here's a basic example of how you can conduct sensitivity analysis using econometric time series models in Python with the `statsmodels` package:

```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.api import VAR

# Load dataset (assuming you have a DataFrame with time series data)
data = pd.read_csv('time_series_data.csv', parse_dates=['Date'], index_col='Date')

# Prepare data
# Ensure that 'Interest_Rate' and 'Deposit_Balance' columns are available in the DataFrame

# Estimate VAR model
model = VAR(data)

# Choose lag order using information criteria or manual selection
# Example using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for lag order selection
lag_order = model.select_order(maxlags=4, ic='aic')

# Fit VAR model with selected lag order
var_results = model.fit(lag_order)

# Analyze Impulse Response Functions
# Example: Compute impulse response functions for a specific period (e.g., 10 periods)
irf = var_results.irf(periods=10)

# Plot impulse response functions
irf.plot(impulse='Interest_Rate', response='Deposit_Balance')
```

In this example:
- We load the time series data containing interest rates and deposit balances over time.
- We prepare the data for analysis.
- We estimate a VAR model using the `VAR` class from `statsmodels`.
- We choose the lag order for the VAR model using information criteria (e.g., AIC).
- We fit the VAR model with the selected lag order to the data.
- We compute impulse response functions using the `irf` method of the fitted VAR model, which quantifies the dynamic relationship between interest rates and deposit balances.
- Finally, we plot the impulse response functions to visualize the short-term and long-term effects of interest rate shocks on deposit balances.
