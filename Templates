# Validation Data

## ANSWER:

The validation methodology for our healthcare claim denial predictor model acknowledges the inherent variability and bias specific to each hospital system's claims processing patterns. Given these institution-specific characteristics, validation is optimally performed using data unique to each healthcare organization rather than employing external, generalized datasets.

For each client implementation, we request a comprehensive 18-24 month historical claims dataset during the onboarding process. From this corpus, we implement a structured data partitioning strategy, systematically segregating portions for validation and testing purposes. This approach ensures model performance evaluation occurs on relevant, client-specific data while maintaining statistical integrity through proper separation of training and evaluation datasets.

Once the model transitions to pilot or production status, we implement a continuous validation framework leveraging incoming claims data. This approach serves two critical functions: (1) ongoing performance assessment under real-world conditions, and (2) progressive model enhancement through periodic retraining with newly acquired data. This cyclic improvement process allows the model to adapt to evolving claims patterns, payer behavior modifications, and coding practice changes, thereby maintaining and potentially improving predictive accuracy over time.

This client-specific validation approach delivers more meaningful performance metrics and ensures the model remains calibrated to each organization's unique revenue cycle characteristics.
