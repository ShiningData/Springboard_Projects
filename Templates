Here's the Python script to process the text file and extract the columns based on the provided rules:

```python
import pandas as pd

def parse_line(line):
    # Strip any surrounding whitespace
    line = line.strip()
    
    # Extract Action (last letter which is 'I' or 'V')
    action = line[-1]
    line = line[:-1]

    # Extract Payee 1 (preceding all letters until digits)
    payee_1 = ''.join([char for char in reversed(line) if not char.isdigit()]).strip()[::-1]
    line = line[:-len(payee_1)]

    # Extract Date (preceding 8 digits)
    date = line[-8:]
    line = line[:-8]

    # Extract Issued Amount (preceding 6 elements)
    issued_amount = line[-6:]
    line = line[:-6]

    # Extract Serial Number (preceding 10 digits)
    serial_number = line[-10:]
    line = line[:-10]

    # Extract Account Number (preceding 10 digits)
    account_number = line[-10:]

    return {
        'Account Number': account_number,
        'Serial Number': serial_number,
        'Action': action,
        'Payee 1': payee_1,
        'Date': date,
        'Issued Amount': issued_amount
    }

# Read the text file
file_path = 'your_file.txt'  # Replace with your actual file path
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

# Parse each line
data = [parse_line(line.strip()) for line in lines]

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the DataFrame
print(df)

# Example: Saving to a CSV file
df.to_csv('parsed_output.csv', index=False)
```

This script does the following:

1. Defines the `parse_line` function to parse each line of the text file and extract the columns based on the given rules.
2. Reads the lines from the text file.
3. Parses each line using the `parse_line` function.
4. Creates a DataFrame from the parsed data.
5. Prints the DataFrame and saves it to a CSV file if desired.

Replace `'your_file.txt'` with the actual path to your text file to use this script.
