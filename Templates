The project's objective is to predict claim denial status by reverse-engineering the adjudication systems used by different payers. Understanding payer-specific behaviors is crucial since different payers have distinct rules for denying or approving claims. For instance, Payer A might deny a claim type that Payer B would approve, and vice versa. This makes it essential to have payer-specific data for accurate predictions.
To illustrate, Payer A denies 45 out of 50 claims and pays 5, while Payer B denies 5 out of 50 and pays 45. Predictions based on payer-specific data are more accurate. However, combining data from multiple payers reduces predictive value because it obscures which payerâ€™s denial rate applies. Knowing payer-specific behaviors helps providers navigate payer rules and improves claim approval predictions.
Dr. Saeed, a cardiologist in Pittsburgh, has many Medicare patients due to their age and heart conditions. If his practice saw 1000 patients last year, with 500 on Medicare and only 2 from a smaller payer like Acme Health Plan, it is difficult to predict claims for Acme due to insufficient data. Hence, predictions should focus on larger, data-rich payers.
To improve predictions, a provider-specific crosswalk table is necessary. This table maps payer names and identifiers from claim data (835 forms) to normalized payer names, ensuring consistency and accuracy. For instance, if a claim says "ABC Health Plan," it should match with the payer ID from the 835 forms 97% of the time. Setting thresholds and discussing them with customers can help in making accurate, payer-specific predictions.
Carrying payer names and IDs from 837 forms (claim submissions) forward into the model is essential. Conversations with customers are needed to confirm the business logic and ensure agreement on the data mapping. Starting with whatever information is in the 835 forms and ensuring it matches the 837 data helps maintain accuracy. For low volume payers, predictions might not be as reliable due to insufficient data.
Ultimately, the goal is to make accurate predictions and provide actionable insights to providers on how to fix claims to get them paid rather than just predicting denials. This approach is more valuable and practical for providers seeking to improve their claim approval rates.
