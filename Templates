Conduct sensitivity analysis for the interest rate change on deposit balance using Simultaneous Equations Models in python as stated below:
Simultaneous Equations Models:
Apply simultaneous equations models to estimate the joint determination of interest rates and deposit balances, considering feedback effects between the two variables.
Analyze how changes in interest rates affect deposit balances and vice versa, accounting for endogeneity and feedback loops.
The statsmodels package in Python offers functionalities for estimating simultaneous equations models.

To conduct sensitivity analysis for the impact of interest rate changes on deposit balance using Simultaneous Equations Models in Python, you can use the `statsmodels` package. Here's a general approach to perform this analysis:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: If you haven't already installed `statsmodels`, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install statsmodels
```

2. **Prepare Data**: Prepare your dataset, including historical data on both interest rates and deposit balances.

3. **Specify Simultaneous Equations Model**: Define the simultaneous equations model that captures the joint determination of interest rates and deposit balances, considering feedback effects between the two variables. This model typically consists of equations for both interest rates and deposit balances, with each equation including variables from both categories.

4. **Estimate Model Parameters**: Use the `OLS` (Ordinary Least Squares) class from `statsmodels` to estimate the parameters of the simultaneous equations model.

5. **Analyze Results**: Analyze the estimated model parameters to understand how changes in interest rates affect deposit balances and vice versa, accounting for endogeneity and feedback loops.

Here's an example of how you can conduct sensitivity analysis using Simultaneous Equations Models in Python with the `statsmodels` package:

```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Step 1: Prepare Data
# Assuming you have a DataFrame with historical data on interest rates and deposit balances
data = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv')

# Step 2: Specify Simultaneous Equations Model
# Define the simultaneous equations model
# Example: Deposit_Balance = β0 + β1 * Interest_Rate + ε1
#          Interest_Rate = γ0 + γ1 * Deposit_Balance + ε2
# Where ε1 and ε2 are error terms

# Step 3: Estimate Model Parameters
# Create design matrices for the dependent and independent variables
X_deposit = sm.add_constant(data['Interest_Rate'])
y_deposit = data['Deposit_Balance']
X_interest = sm.add_constant(data['Deposit_Balance'])
y_interest = data['Interest_Rate']

# Fit simultaneous equations model for deposit balances
model_deposit = sm.OLS(y_deposit, X_deposit)
results_deposit = model_deposit.fit()

# Fit simultaneous equations model for interest rates
model_interest = sm.OLS(y_interest, X_interest)
results_interest = model_interest.fit()

# Step 4: Analyze Results
# Analyze estimated coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels
print("Deposit Balance Model:")
print(results_deposit.summary())
print("\nInterest Rate Model:")
print(results_interest.summary())
```

In this example:
- We prepare the historical dataset containing data on both interest rates and deposit balances.
- We specify the simultaneous equations model, which includes equations for both interest rates and deposit balances.
- We estimate the parameters of the simultaneous equations model using the `OLS` class from `statsmodels`.
- We analyze the results of the model estimation, including coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels, to understand how changes in interest rates affect deposit balances and vice versa, accounting for endogeneity and feedback loops.

Conduct sensitivity analysis for the interest rate change on deposit balance via Spatial Econometric Analysis as stated below:
Spatial Econometric Analysis:
Explore spatial dependencies and spillover effects in the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes across geographical regions or market segments.
Estimate spatial econometric models to account for spatial autocorrelation and analyze how sensitivity patterns vary spatially.

1. **Install Required Libraries**: If you haven't already installed `PySAL`, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install pysal
```

2. **Prepare Spatial Data**: Prepare your spatial dataset, including information on deposit balances, interest rates, and spatial relationships between geographical regions or market segments.

3. **Specify Spatial Econometric Model**: Define a spatial econometric model that accounts for spatial dependencies and spillover effects in the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes. This model typically includes spatial lag terms to capture spatial autocorrelation.

4. **Estimate Model Parameters**: Use the functionalities provided by `PySAL` to estimate the parameters of the spatial econometric model.

5. **Analyze Results**: Analyze the estimated model parameters to understand how the sensitivity patterns of deposit balances to interest rate changes vary spatially and identify any significant spatial dependencies or spillover effects.

# Step 1: Prepare Spatial Data
# Assuming you have a DataFrame with spatial data, including deposit balances, interest rates, and spatial relationships
data = pd.read_csv('spatial_data.csv')

# Step 2: Specify Spatial Econometric Model
# Define the spatial econometric model
# Example: Y = XB + ρWY + ε
# Where Y is the vector of deposit balances, X is the matrix of explanatory variables (including interest rates),
# ρ is the spatial autoregressive coefficient, W is the spatial weights matrix, and ε is the error term.

# Step 3: Estimate Model Parameters
# Define spatial weights matrix (W) to capture spatial relationships
# Example: Assuming contiguity-based spatial weights
w = spm.weights.ContiguityWeights(data['spatial_variable'])

# Fit spatial lag model using the spatial lag operator
model = spm.GM_Lag(data['Deposit_Balance'], data[['Interest_Rate', 'other_explanatory_variables']], w)

# Estimate model parameters

Conduct sensitivity analysis for the interest rate change on deposit balance via Bayesian Network Modeling in python as stated below:
Bayesian Network Modeling:
Construct Bayesian network models to represent probabilistic dependencies between interest rate changes, deposit balances, and other relevant variables.
Use Bayesian inference to propagate uncertainties and assess the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes within the network framework.
Libraries like pgmpy offer functionalities for Bayesian network modeling in Python.

To conduct sensitivity analysis for the impact of interest rate changes on deposit balance via Bayesian Network Modeling in Python, you can use the `pgmpy` library. Here's a general approach to perform this analysis:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: If you haven't already installed `pgmpy`, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install pgmpy
```

2. **Prepare Data**: Prepare your dataset, including information on interest rate changes, deposit balances, and other relevant variables.

3. **Construct Bayesian Network**: Define the structure of the Bayesian network to represent probabilistic dependencies between interest rate changes, deposit balances, and other variables. You'll need to specify the nodes (variables) and edges (dependencies) in the network.

4. **Learn Probabilistic Dependencies**: Use data-driven methods to learn the conditional probability distributions of the variables in the Bayesian network from the dataset. This step involves estimating the parameters of the network based on observed data.

5. **Perform Bayesian Inference**: Use Bayesian inference to propagate uncertainties and assess the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes within the Bayesian network framework. You can analyze how changes in interest rates affect deposit balances by observing the posterior distributions of deposit balances conditioned on different interest rate scenarios.

Here's an example of how you can conduct sensitivity analysis using Bayesian Network Modeling in Python with the `pgmpy` library:

```python
from pgmpy.models import BayesianNetwork
from pgmpy.estimators import BayesianEstimator
import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Prepare Data
# Assuming you have a DataFrame with data on interest rate changes, deposit balances, and other variables
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Step 2: Construct Bayesian Network
# Define the structure of the Bayesian network
model = BayesianNetwork([('Interest_Rate', 'Deposit_Balance'),
                         ('Other_Variable', 'Deposit_Balance'),
                         # Add other relevant dependencies as needed
                         ])

# Step 3: Learn Probabilistic Dependencies
# Use Bayesian parameter estimation to learn the conditional probability distributions
model.fit(data, estimator=BayesianEstimator)

# Step 4: Perform Bayesian Inference
# Perform inference to propagate uncertainties and assess the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes
# Example: Compute posterior distributions of deposit balances conditioned on different interest rate scenarios
# Note: You can use the pgmpy inference methods for this purpose
# Example: posterior = model.predict_probability(variables=['Deposit_Balance'], evidence={'Interest_Rate': interest_rate_value})

# Analyze the posterior distributions to understand the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes
# Example: Compute mean, median, or other statistics of the posterior distributions
```

In this example:
- We prepare the dataset containing data on interest rate changes, deposit balances, and other relevant variables.
- We construct a Bayesian network to represent probabilistic dependencies between these variables.
- We learn the conditional probability distributions of the variables from the dataset using Bayesian parameter estimation.
- We use Bayesian inference to propagate uncertainties and assess the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes within the Bayesian network framework.

----
Certainly! Here's the revised step 4 with a code snippet for performing Bayesian inference and analyzing posterior distributions:

```python
# Step 4: Perform Bayesian Inference
# Perform inference to propagate uncertainties and assess the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes

# Import necessary module for inference
from pgmpy.inference import VariableElimination

# Create an inference object using VariableElimination
inference = VariableElimination(model)

# Define the interest rate scenario for which you want to analyze the sensitivity
interest_rate_value = 0.03  # Example interest rate value

# Compute posterior distributions of deposit balances conditioned on different interest rate scenarios
posterior = inference.query(variables=['Deposit_Balance'], evidence={'Interest_Rate': interest_rate_value})

# Analyze the posterior distributions to understand the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes
# For example, you can compute the mean or median of the posterior distribution
mean_deposit_balance = posterior.values[0]
print("Mean Deposit Balance for Interest Rate Change of", interest_rate_value, ":", mean_deposit_balance)
```

In this code snippet:
- We import the `VariableElimination` module from `pgmpy.inference` to perform Bayesian inference.
- We create an inference object using `VariableElimination` and provide the Bayesian network model to it.
- We define the interest rate scenario for which we want to analyze the sensitivity.
- We use the `query` method of the inference object to compute the posterior distribution of deposit balances conditioned on the specified interest rate scenario.
- Finally, we analyze the posterior distribution to understand the sensitivity of deposit balances to the interest rate changes.
