Of course! Let's customize the explanation specifically for a multiclass classification model with 8 distinct counterparty result codes in PyCaret.

In a multiclass setting, each of these metrics can be computed for each class by treating it as the positive class while grouping the rest as negative. Here's the breakdown tailored to your model:

1. **Precision for each counterparty result code**: This indicates the proportion of predictions for a specific counterparty result code that were actually correct. A higher precision for a counterparty result code means that when your model predicts that code, it's likely correct.

2. **Recall (Sensitivity) for each counterparty result code**: This metric tells you the proportion of actual instances of a specific counterparty result code that your model correctly identified. A high recall for a counterparty result code means that your model catches most instances of that code.

3. **F1-Score for each counterparty result code**: This is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall for each counterparty result code. It offers a balanced measure, especially useful if the costs of false positives and false negatives differ.

4. **Support for each counterparty result code**: This tells you the number of actual occurrences of each counterparty result code in your dataset. If you have imbalances (some codes are rarer than others), this metric can help you understand the weights of each class.

5. **Accuracy**: This gives the proportion of all predictions that were correct, irrespective of the counterparty result code.

6. **Macro Avg**: This gives the average metric value, considering each of the 8 counterparty result codes equally, regardless of their prevalence in the dataset.

7. **Weighted Avg**: This gives the average metric value, weighted by the support (number of true instances) for each counterparty result code.

In PyCaret, to visualize these metrics for your trained multiclass model, you would use:

```python
plot_model(model, plot = 'class_report')
```

Where `model` is your trained multiclass model object.

Given the multiclass nature of your problem with 8 different counterparty result codes, it's crucial to look at the metrics for each individual class, especially if the dataset is imbalanced. Some codes might be harder to predict than others, and this breakdown will help pinpoint where the model might need improvement.
