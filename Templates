Subject: Next Steps for Updated MRMG Documentation

Hi [Client’s Name],

Thanks for reaching out! I appreciate you keeping this on track. I’m happy to take the lead and ensure we complete the updated documentation smoothly within the deadline.

Yesterday, I had a meeting with Daniel and Monika to clarify our roadmap from the MRMG standpoint, including which documents we need to prepare and how to expedite this process. I assume this is why Monika reached out to you as well.

I’ll review the documents today and set up a meeting with you to discuss our approach and any areas that may need your input. This will help us align on the best way to proceed efficiently.

You can expect a calendar invite shortly. Looking forward to working through this with you.
