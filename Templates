Introduction:

In this research project, we have conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of interest rate changes on deposit balance. Each notebook in this collection presents a different approach to conducting sensitivity analysis, with code snippets tailored to our specific dataset. Through the application of various methodologies, ranging from traditional statistical methods to advanced machine learning algorithms, we aimed to provide a holistic understanding of the sensitivity of deposit balances to fluctuations in interest rates.

The primary objective of this research was to assess how changes in interest rates affect deposit balances across different analytical frameworks. By applying each approach to our dataset, we aimed to obtain actionable insights into the relationship between interest rate dynamics and deposit balance fluctuations. However, it is important to note that the code snippets provided in these notebooks are in a generalized format and have not yet been applied to our actual data. Therefore, readers are encouraged to adapt the code to their specific datasets and interpret the results within the context of their own analyses.

Through this research endeavor, we aim to contribute to the body of knowledge surrounding the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes. By sharing our methodologies and results, we hope to facilitate further research in this area and provide valuable insights for decision-making processes within financial institutions. We invite readers to explore the notebooks presented in this collection and engage with the diverse methodologies employed to investigate the sensitivity of deposit balances to interest rate changes.
