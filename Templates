Types of Classification
Binary Classification

The simplest type of classification, where there are only two possible outcomes.
Example: Spam Detection – Emails are classified as either Spam or Not Spam.
Common algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Multiclass Classification

More than two classes, but each instance belongs to only one class.
Example: Digit Recognition – Classifying handwritten digits (0-9).
Common algorithms: Decision Trees, XGBoost, Neural Networks.
Multi-label Classification

Each instance can belong to multiple categories at the same time.
Example: Movie Genre Prediction – A movie can be labeled as Action, Comedy, and Sci-Fi at the same time.
Common algorithms: Neural Networks, Multi-label Random Forest, and specialized versions of classifiers with Sigmoid activation.
Each type has different challenges and requires different evaluation metrics (e.g., Accuracy vs. Precision-Recall trade-offs in multi-label classification).
