To conduct sensitivity analysis with Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) in Python using the `statsmodels` package, you can follow a similar approach to the VAR model. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: If you haven't already installed `statsmodels`, you can do so via pip:

```bash
pip install statsmodels
```

2. **Prepare Data**: Prepare your time series data for analysis, ensuring that you have both interest rates and deposit balances over time.

3. **Estimate VECM Model**: Estimate a VECM model using the `VECM` class from `statsmodels`.

4. **Analyze Impulse Response Functions**: Use the estimated model to analyze impulse response functions, which quantify the short-term and long-term effects of interest rate shocks on deposit balances.

Here's an example of how you can conduct sensitivity analysis with VECM in Python using the `statsmodels` package:

```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.api import VECM

# Load dataset (assuming you have a DataFrame with time series data)
data = pd.read_csv('time_series_data.csv', parse_dates=['Date'], index_col='Date')

# Prepare data
# Ensure that 'Interest_Rate' and 'Deposit_Balance' columns are available in the DataFrame

# Estimate VECM model
model = VECM(data, k_ar_diff=2)  # Specify the number of lags for differencing

# Fit VECM model
vecm_results = model.fit()

# Analyze Impulse Response Functions
# Example: Compute impulse response functions for a specific period (e.g., 10 periods)
irf = vecm_results.irf(periods=10)

# Plot impulse response functions
irf.plot(impulse='Interest_Rate', response='Deposit_Balance')
```

In this example:
- We load the time series data containing interest rates and deposit balances over time.
- We prepare the data for analysis.
- We estimate a VECM model using the `VECM` class from `statsmodels`, specifying the number of lags for differencing.
- We fit the VECM model to the data.
- We compute impulse response functions using the `irf` method of the fitted VECM model, which quantifies the dynamic relationship between interest rates and deposit balances.
- Finally, we plot the impulse response functions to visualize the short-term and long-term effects of interest rate shocks on deposit balances.
