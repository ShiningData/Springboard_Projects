Model outputs serve as an adjunct tool for decision-making and risk identification rather than as the sole criterion. By integrating historical time series data from various PNC Business Lines, the model provides forecasts that inform the decision-making process.

In this context, model outputs are intended to support, rather than replace, the nuanced judgment of experienced professionals, thus playing a contributory but not exclusive role in the decision-making ecosystem.
