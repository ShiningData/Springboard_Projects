 PMT: Dashboard Requirements Analysis

 1. Current Challenges and Gaps

 Limited Upstream Acknowledgment Visibility
- GPP acknowledgment gaps: Historically poor request-response models from GPP require compensating mechanisms like pending queue monitoring and 5-minute timeout alerts
- Manual intervention dependency: Operational teams rely on workarounds and alert systems rather than systematic acknowledgment tracking from payment engines
- Processing delay detection: Cannot proactively identify when upstream requests remain unacknowledged, creating potential payment processing bottlenecks

 Fragmented Downstream Notification Coverage
- Fire-and-forget intraday services: No acknowledgment requirements from downstream applications receiving notifications, creating blind spots for delivery failures
- Selective failure notifications: Only mainframe applications (CFE, GL) provide systematic missing file alerts; other applications lack monitoring capabilities
- Manual coordination dependency: Missing transaction detection relies on downstream teams contacting PMT rather than automated notification systems

 Inconsistent Service Level Monitoring
- Service type variations: Real-time, intraday, end-of-day, and support services have different failure handling and monitoring approaches
- Limited volume tracking: Only manual end-of-day volume monitoring by operations team; no automated baseline tracking across service types
- Incident-driven visibility: Operational issues only surface through automated incidents or manual escalation rather than proactive monitoring

 Integration Complexity Without Unified Tracking
- Multiple protocol management: CICS, MQ, API, and RPC integrations lack unified monitoring across communication methods
- Direct database access risks: Authorized direct access to PRT and PME databases creates potential blind spots for integration health
- MID dependency: Reliance on upstream-generated Message Identifiers without PMT-specific tracking for middleware processing steps

 2. Recommendations

 Enhanced Upstream Integration Monitoring
- Systematic acknowledgment tracking: Implement comprehensive request-response monitoring for all GPP interactions with automated alerting for unacknowledged requests
- Pending queue automation: Replace manual pending queue monitoring with automated tracking and escalation for processing delays
- Multi-engine integration: Expand monitoring beyond GPP to cover all upstream payment engines with standardized acknowledgment requirements

 Comprehensive Downstream Notification Framework
- Universal acknowledgment collection: Implement systematic confirmation requirements from all downstream applications, not just mainframe systems
- Proactive missing file detection: Deploy automated monitoring for all end-of-day batch processes with immediate alerting when files aren't received
- Intraday service confirmation: Add acknowledgment capabilities to fire-and-forget notification services for complete delivery visibility

 Unified Service Level Dashboard
- Cross-service monitoring: Create single dashboard covering real-time, intraday, end-of-day, and support services with consistent SLA tracking
- Automated volume baselining: Implement systematic volume tracking across all service types with deviation alerting
- Protocol-agnostic visibility: Provide unified monitoring regardless of communication method (CICS, MQ, API, RPC)

 Middleware-Specific Value Tracking
- Integration performance metrics: Track transformation times, protocol conversion success rates, and downstream delivery confirmation
- Service dependency mapping: Monitor critical dependencies like RTS, EFG, and ACBS with impact assessment for payment engine operations
- End-to-end correlation: Enhance MID tracking with PMT-specific processing milestones for complete middleware visibility

 Proactive Issue Prevention
- Compensating control automation: Convert manual workarounds and timeout alerts into systematic automated monitoring
- Service health prediction: Implement trend analysis to identify degrading performance before service failures occur
- Cross-system integration health: Monitor direct database access patterns and integration points for early warning of potential issues
