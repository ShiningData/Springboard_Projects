 PSG: Dashboard Requirements Analysis

 1. Current Challenges and Gaps

 Limited Transaction Tracking
- Inconsistent identifier generation: Real-time payments bypass FTM and don't generate PSG Transaction IDs, creating tracking gaps for time-sensitive payments
- Dual processing paths: FTM vs. direct-to-PRT routing creates visibility inconsistencies across payment types
- No comprehensive internal reporting: PSG relies entirely on COD event streaming without internal transaction lifecycle visibility

 Reconciliation Deficiencies
- Immature downstream reconciliation: Automated reconciliation runs every 3-4 hours but lacks comprehensive coverage across all payment types
- Manual reconciliation dependency: End-of-day processes rely heavily on manual checks rather than automated missing transaction detection
- Limited notification mechanisms: Downstream systems provide minimal automated alerts for missing files or transactions

 Processing Visibility Gaps
- Format transformation blind spots: Multiple inbound formats (ISO XML, legacy BSI, JSON) with limited visibility into conversion failures or processing bottlenecks
- Routing decision opacity: Intelligent routing to PME, PRT, or ACH systems lacks transparent decision tracking for troubleshooting
- Dual database complexity: DB2 and Oracle systems create data fragmentation without unified monitoring

 2. Recommendations

 Enhanced Transaction Tracking
- Standardize identifier management: Generate consistent PSG Transaction IDs for all payments, including real-time payments that bypass FTM
- Unified processing visibility: Create single dashboard view covering both FTM and direct-to-PRT processing paths
- Real-time status tracking: Implement comprehensive status updates from payment receipt through downstream delivery

 Proactive Reconciliation Framework
- Automated missing transaction detection: Implement real-time alerts when downstream systems don't acknowledge expected transactions within defined timeframes
- Enhanced downstream communication: Establish systematic acknowledgment requirements from PME, PRT, and ACH systems
- Volume baseline monitoring: Create automated tracking for expected transaction volumes with deviation alerting

 Dashboard Integration Requirements
- Multi-format processing metrics: Monitor transformation success rates and processing times across ISO XML, BSI, JSON, and other formats
- Intelligent routing transparency: Track routing decisions and downstream system performance to identify optimal payment paths
- Cross-database correlation: Unify DB2 and Oracle transaction data for comprehensive payment lifecycle visibility
- COD event enhancement: Leverage existing COD streaming while adding real-time operational dashboards for immediate issue detection

 Failure Prevention Capabilities
- Format validation alerting: Proactive alerts for transformation failures or format compatibility issues before downstream processing
- Processing bottleneck identification: Monitor FTM performance issues and automated recovery events to prevent client impact
- Peak period monitoring: Enhanced automated monitoring during month-end, quarter-end, and year-end processing periods
