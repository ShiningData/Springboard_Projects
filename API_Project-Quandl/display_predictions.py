 HCA: Dashboard Requirements Analysis

 1. Current Challenges and Gaps

 Limited Payment Flow Integration
- Post-payment reporting only: HCA operates after deposits are collected and only reports on collection activities, not participating in actual payment processing
- Payment-remittance timing gaps: Remittance advice can arrive days or weeks before or after actual settlement, creating client posting challenges without affecting dollar flow
- No payment failure visibility: Since they don't participate in payment origination or processing, cannot detect or alert on payment flow issues

 Inadequate Upstream/Downstream Monitoring
- No acknowledgment systems: Receive no confirmations from downstream applications like Pinnacle or upstream sources (lockbox, ACH, direct X12 835 transmissions)
- Manual file completeness detection: Rely on mainframe job completion status rather than systematic data validation or missing file alerts
- Client-driven missing file detection: Only discover missing remittance files when healthcare providers contact them asking "where's our file?"

 Inconsistent Volume and Relationship Monitoring
- Best efforts payer monitoring: SME-based knowledge within operations group rather than systematic tracking of payer relationships and data delivery
- Variable payer frequency challenges: Different payers operate on daily, weekly, or bi-monthly schedules making baseline volume tracking difficult
- Claims-based volume tracking limitations: Monitor from claims perspective but lack systematic early warning for payer connection issues

 Data Integration and Processing Gaps
- Multiple format complexity: Handle Nacha, X12, and various BAI formats from lockbox without unified processing monitoring
- Trace number dependency: Rely on ACH trace numbers or X12 trace numbers for reassociation process without additional tracking mechanisms
- COD consumer only: Receive data from COD but don't contribute operational data back to enterprise monitoring systems

 2. Recommendations

 Enhanced Remittance-Payment Correlation Monitoring
- Timing gap alerting: Implement automated alerts when payment deposits occur without corresponding remittance advice within defined timeframes
- Reassociation failure tracking: Monitor trace number matching success rates to identify systematic issues with payment-remittance correlation
- Provider impact assessment: Track which healthcare providers are affected by remittance delays to prioritize issue resolution

 Proactive File and Data Monitoring
- Systematic payer relationship tracking: Replace SME-based monitoring with automated tracking of payer data delivery patterns and connection health
- Expected file monitoring: Implement baseline tracking for regular payers (daily, weekly, bi-monthly) with automated alerts for missing transmissions
- Multi-format processing metrics: Monitor success rates across Nacha, X12, and BAI format processing to identify format-specific issues

 Dashboard Integration Components
- Remittance advice delivery tracking: Monitor time gaps between payment deposits and remittance advice delivery to healthcare providers
- Payer connection health dashboard: Track data flow patterns from each payer with alerts for unusual gaps or delivery failures
- Client impact visibility: Show which healthcare providers are experiencing posting delays due to missing or delayed remittance information

 Upstream Data Flow Monitoring
- Lockbox and ACH feed monitoring: Implement systematic tracking of data feeds from lockbox and ACH systems with automated missing data detection
- X12 835 transmission tracking: Monitor direct payer transmissions for completeness and timing
- PNC e-payments integration: Track refund file creation process to ensure healthcare client refund posting capabilities

 Alert Framework for Healthcare-Specific Issues
- Provider notification automation: Proactively alert healthcare providers when remittance advice is delayed rather than waiting for client inquiries
- Payer relationship escalation: Automatic escalation to payer relations teams when systematic delivery issues are detected
- Claims posting impact alerts: Identify when remittance delays could significantly impact provider revenue cycle management

 Operational Monitoring Enhancement
- Mainframe job dependency tracking: Monitor critical mainframe job completion status that affects lockbox and ACH data availability
- Database schema performance: Track Oracle database performance across different schemas handling various healthcare data types
- UI accessibility monitoring: Ensure healthcare provider clients can consistently access reports and status information through user interface
