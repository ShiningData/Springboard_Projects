 PST: Dashboard Requirements Analysis

 1. Current Challenges and Gaps

 Limited End-to-End Visibility
- Downstream processing blind spots: Cannot see failures after successful handoff to MLP, PTD, or other downstream systems - if MLP accepts but PRT fails, PST remains unaware
- No missing file notifications: Downstream systems don't alert PST when expected files/transactions aren't received, requiring indirect detection through reconciliation discrepancies
- Payment completion dependency: Final payment success depends on recipient actions (payment method selection) outside PST's visibility or control

 Fragmented Status Tracking
- Timer-based failure detection only: 1-hour SLA monitoring catches stuck transactions but doesn't provide predictive insights or root cause analysis
- Basic internal reporting: Rudimentary daily reports lack modern BI capabilities and comprehensive payment lifecycle metrics
- Client autonomy challenges: Variable payment patterns make volume tracking impossible, but this creates gaps in operational oversight

 Integration Monitoring Limitations
- Mixed acknowledgment coverage: While MLP API and PTD provide "ACTC" responses, not all downstream integrations offer systematic confirmations
- Dual database complexity: Oracle-to-MongoDB transition creates data management challenges and potential inconsistencies during migration
- Multi-format processing risks: Supporting CSV, JSON, and API formats without unified validation monitoring

 Process Handoff Gaps
- Trace ID fragmentation: While PST generates unique trace IDs, tracking becomes inconsistent as payments flow through different downstream systems with varying identifier conventions
- No cross-system correlation: Cannot correlate PST trace IDs with downstream processing events to identify where failures occur in the payment chain

 2. Recommendations

 Enhanced End-to-End Monitoring
- Downstream system integration: Establish systematic status feedback from MLP, PTD, ACH, and CPY systems beyond initial acceptance confirmations
- Payment completion tracking: Monitor recipient interactions and payment method selections to identify stalled payments requiring intervention
- Cross-system correlation: Implement trace ID tracking through downstream systems to maintain visibility after PST handoff

 Proactive Issue Detection
- Predictive alerting: Enhance timer-based monitoring with trend analysis to identify patterns before 1-hour SLA breaches occur
- Missing transaction detection: Implement automated reconciliation with downstream systems to identify unreceived files or processing gaps
- Integration health monitoring: Track API response patterns and file transmission success rates across all downstream connections

 Comprehensive Status Dashboard
- Real-time payment lifecycle view: Create unified dashboard showing payment progression from PST through all downstream systems until final completion
- Client-specific monitoring: Track payment patterns by client to identify unusual volume deviations or processing anomalies
- Multi-format processing metrics: Monitor success rates and error patterns across CSV, JSON, and API submission methods

 Dashboard Data Requirements
- Systematic downstream acknowledgments: Collect confirmation data from all payment rails (RTP via MLP, Visa Direct via PTD, ACH via Dell)
- Recipient interaction tracking: Monitor payee actions and payment method selections that impact final payment completion
- Database migration monitoring: Track Oracle-to-MongoDB transition impacts on processing performance and data consistency
- Format transformation metrics: Monitor conversion success rates between inbound formats and downstream system requirements

 Alert Framework for Dashboard
- Payment stall detection: Identify payments stuck in non-permanent statuses beyond normal processing windows
- Downstream system health: Alert when acceptance rates from MLP, PTD, or other systems decline below baseline
- Volume anomaly detection: Flag unusual client payment submission patterns that might indicate processing issues
- Integration failure escalation: Route different failure types (data quality vs. system connectivity) to appropriate resolution teams
