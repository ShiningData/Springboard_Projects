 GPP PRT/PME: Dashboard Requirements Analysis

 1. Current Challenges and Gaps

 Monitoring and Alerting Deficiencies
- No automated volume tracking: Only selective manual monitoring for specific clients, creating blind spots for anomaly detection
- Missing file detection gaps: No systematic notifications when downstream systems don't receive expected files/transactions
- Manual failure identification: Run-the-bank teams rely on reactive problem-solving rather than proactive issue detection

 Limited End-to-End Visibility
- No acknowledgment tracking: Fire-and-forget model with most downstream systems provides no confirmation of successful processing
- Fragmented status information: Multiple status checking mechanisms (Pinnacle, CAP API, files) without unified visibility
- Processing bottleneck identification: Cannot pinpoint where delays or failures occur in the payment lifecycle

 Data Integration Gaps
- COD streaming only: Real-time data flows to enterprise warehouse but limited operational monitoring data availability
- MID tracking limitations: While transactions have unique identifiers, cross-system correlation for dashboard purposes needs enhancement

 2. Recommendations

 Dashboard Data Requirements
- Implement real-time transaction tracking: Capture MID-based transaction flow through all processing stages
- Create volume baseline monitoring: Establish automated tracking for all major clients with deviation alerting
- Build acknowledgment collection: Implement systematic confirmation tracking from critical downstream systems (STX, GL, RCF, CFE)

 Proactive Monitoring Capabilities
- Payment lifecycle visibility: Track transactions from upstream submission through downstream delivery with stage-specific timing metrics
- Automated anomaly detection: Flag unusual volume patterns, processing delays, and missing acknowledgments before client notification
- Interface health monitoring: Monitor MDM, RTS, and other critical system integrations with automated failure alerting

 Dashboard Integration Points
- Upstream integration: Capture submission data from CAP, Pinnacle, PSI, and file channels
- Internal processing metrics: Monitor validation, sanctions screening, and processing workflow performance
- Downstream confirmation tracking: Implement systematic acknowledgment collection from key systems

 Alert Framework
- Pre-emptive client communication: Automatically notify clients of processing delays or issues before they inquire
- Escalation workflows: Route different failure types to appropriate resolution teams (run-the-bank, compliance, technical)
- SLA monitoring: Track processing times against client expectations with automated breach notifications
