Subject: Data Quality Presentation Materials for Sibos Panel

Dear [Recipient’s Name],

Badel informed me regarding your request for my expertise in supporting your upcoming data quality presentation at the Sibos panel. Based on my conversation with him and my understanding of the presentation’s scope and content, I have prepared 22 slides that you may incorporate into your deck.

The material covers:

Data quality dimensions

Tools, approaches, and optimization strategies

An action plan framework

Industry-level maturity assessment questions

I have not included visual images or charts, as I thought you might prefer to design and arrange those to align with your presentation style.

Before our scheduled meeting, I wanted to share these materials with you so you can review them in advance. I look forward to our discussion and to contributing to a successful panel session.
