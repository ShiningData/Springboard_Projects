To the Admissions Committee,  
Georgia Institute of Technology  
Master’s Program in Data Science

I am delighted to write this letter of recommendation for Berna Ari, whom I had the privilege of mentoring during her upskilling journey in data science and while she undertook several ambitious projects. Berna stands out as a rare talent—combining technical excellence, intellectual curiosity, and a genuine passion for using data to drive meaningful business impact.

From the outset, Berna impressed me with her exceptional analytical skills and her ability to quickly master advanced concepts. Her academic achievements speak volumes: she graduated from the University of North Texas with a flawless 4.0 GPA, consistently earning a place on the President’s List throughout her studies[1]. Yet, it is her drive to apply this knowledge in real-world contexts that truly distinguishes her. At CHRISTUS Health, Berna engineered and maintained over ten SQL-based pipelines, transforming massive datasets to deliver over 95% data accuracy and directly supporting the needs of six business units[1]. Her work not only improved data reliability but also fostered collaboration across multiple teams—a testament to her technical acumen and interpersonal skills.

Berna’s approach to data science is both rigorous and creative. In our mentorship sessions, she routinely sought feedback, demonstrated a willingness to tackle complex challenges, and displayed a remarkable capacity for independent problem-solving. Her project on Retail Vision Analytics, where she engineered a YOLO and OpenCV system for real-time object tracking, is a prime example. Berna not only developed the technical solution but also worked closely with retail staff to ensure seamless implementation, training end-users and iterating based on their feedback[1]. This rare blend of technical depth and user-centric thinking is precisely what sets her apart.

Beyond her technical prowess, Berna is a natural collaborator. She has worked with cross-functional teams, integrating and standardizing master data, and has consistently proposed enhancements to boost data reliability and performance[1]. Her communication skills are outstanding—she can translate complex technical findings into actionable insights for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. During her internship at port-neo, for instance, she built interactive dashboards that accelerated team decision-making by 25% and cut report generation time by 30%[1]. These results reflect her commitment to not just delivering solutions, but to driving real, measurable improvements.

Berna’s integrity, resilience, and humility make her a joy to mentor and a valued team member. She is never satisfied with the status quo, always seeking opportunities to learn and contribute more. I am confident that she will thrive in the challenging, collaborative environment at Georgia Tech, and that she will contribute significantly to your academic community.

I give Berna my highest recommendation for admission to your Master’s program. She has the intellect, work ethic, and character to excel and to make a lasting impact. Please feel free to contact me should you require any further information.
