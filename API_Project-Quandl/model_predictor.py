Current Challenges and Gaps

Fragmented Monitoring Landscape: PPO operates with multiple disconnected monitoring tools (Dynatrace, Glass Box, Elastic, Humio, Log Scale) but lacks a holistic health dashboard. The Elastic dashboards remain "not fully built" and only provide directional insights, while comprehensive monitoring exists only for legacy PPO 1.0 through Tableau, not the modern PPO 2.0 system.

Reconcilement and File Processing Vulnerabilities: Critical gaps exist in end-to-end file reconcilement monitoring. PPO can confirm file delivery and timing but lacks robust mechanisms to verify complete record processing. A documented incident illustrates this risk: a syntax error in an ACH file caused processing to halt mid-stream, resulting in only 4,000 of 10,000 expected payments being processed, with the discrepancy going undetected initially.

Complex Architecture Without Unified Oversight: Managing payments across four different lending systems of record (FDR, ACLS, MSP, ACBS) creates operational complexity compared to retail deposits' single system approach. This complexity is compounded by ACBS operating as a pass-through model while the other three systems use PPO as the payment engine.

Limited Transaction Visibility and Tracing: Customers cannot track payment status in transit, and uncertainty exists around unique identifier consistency between API calls and file transfers, hampering end-to-end transaction tracing capabilities.

 Solution Recommendations

Implement Unified Health Dashboard: Develop a comprehensive real-time dashboard consolidating data from all existing monitoring tools, providing holistic visibility into payment system health across all four lending platforms and channels. This addresses the core business need that initiated the research project.

Enhance Reconcilement Controls: Deploy automated reconciliation processes that verify not only file delivery timing but also record counts, dollar amounts, and processing completion rates. Implement exception reporting with automated alerts when discrepancies exceed defined thresholds.

Standardize Transaction Tracking: Establish consistent unique identifier standards across all file and API interactions, enabling complete end-to-end transaction tracing from payment initiation through final posting. Create a centralized transaction registry linking confirmation numbers to all downstream identifiers.

Expand Monitoring Scope: Implement volume-based monitoring alongside existing time-based alerts to detect abnormal payment volumes that could indicate upstream system issues or processing failures. Add predictive analytics to identify patterns that precede system failures.

Modernize Customer Experience: Develop customer-facing payment tracking capabilities, allowing clients to monitor payment status throughout the processing lifecycle, improving transparency and reducing support inquiries.

These solutions would transform PPO from a complex, fragmented operation into a resilient, transparent payment platform with comprehensive monitoring and enhanced reliability across all lending products.
