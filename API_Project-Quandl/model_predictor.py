Payments Flow Mapping
Background

The Payments Flow Mapping project was initiated in response to isolated payment issues that made apparent the limited visibility into where and how breakdowns occur within the end-to-end payments process.
To address this, we launched a comprehensive effort to engage with every group involved in the payment lifecycle within PNC. Through these conversations, we're documenting current-state processes, identifying gaps, and exploring how payments can be more effectively traced from initiation to settlement.
This is a brand-new initiative, and we are currently in the research and discovery phase.

Competitive Position in the Market

Enhanced payment transparency and traceability capabilities provide superior customer experience compared to traditional banking workflows.
Proactive issue identification and resolution reduces operational risk and improves regulatory compliance positioning.
Comprehensive end-to-end visibility creates competitive advantage in payment processing efficiency and reliability.
Advanced monitoring and reconciliation capabilities enable faster problem resolution and reduced customer impact.
Streamlined payment operations support scalable growth and improved cost management across the payments ecosystem.

Strategic Objectives

Develop a comprehensive payments flow mapping framework that provides complete visibility across all payment channels and processing stages.
Establish robust monitoring and alerting systems that enable proactive identification of payment bottlenecks and failures.
Implement streamlined workflows for payment processing that integrate seamlessly with existing banking systems.
Create standardized processes for payment reconciliation and exception handling across all business units.
Build scalable infrastructure that can accommodate growing payment volumes while maintaining operational excellence and regulatory compliance.

Recent Accomplishments

Held two successful cross-functional workshops with key stakeholders across the broader payments organization to align on objectives, discuss challenges, and begin building a shared understanding of the full payments flow.
Conducted deep-dive sessions with the below applications to map current-state processes, identify pain points, and understand system-level tracking capabilities:

SFG, CPX, EDI, PINACLE, WBB, MBL, PPO


Began compiling findings and themes across systems and teams to inform our initial set of comprehensive recommendations.
Started drafting a high-level payments flow diagram to illustrate how transactions move throughout the bank, highlighting visibility gaps, and identifying key opportunities for improved monitoring and traceability.
