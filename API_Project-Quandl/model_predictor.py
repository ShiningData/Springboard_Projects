MRMG Documentation Preparation Process

1. Prepare Required Documentation Based on Tiering Level  
- Based on the model’s assigned tier, begin preparing the required MRMG documentation. The latest acceptable document templates can be found [here](https://app.wss.pncint.net/sites/EMT/MRMGPages/FormsAndTemplates.aspx).  
- Documentation requirements will vary depending on the Model Tier Level associated with your MIF. Be sure to select the appropriate documents before beginning the process. These typically include, but are not limited to:  
    - Model Documentation  
    - Change Log  
    - Outcome Analysis  
    - Operating Manual  
    - Appendix K – Models with Compliance Laws and Regulations (For this form, you may need to coordinate with Meredith B. Andrews regarding applicable Consumer Protection Laws and requirements. There is also an email address provided on the form’s first page for further questions, though response times may vary.)

2. Establish a Documentation Review and Tracking Process  
- Create a timeline and tracking system for documentation preparation, review, and approval.  
- Share a MRMG Review Tracking Form via SharePoint with all collaborators, including CIB MRMG POCs, stakeholders, the DSI Team reviewer, and your manager.
- Use the tracking form to monitor progress, with designated status fields such as Not Started, In Progress, and Completed for each document.
- Ensure all peer reviews, business stakeholder feedback, and input from Monika and Daniel are accurately documented in the tracking form.
- The model developer will coordinate and oversee all documentation efforts.

3. Conduct Team Review and Alignment  
- Upon completion of initial documentation and reviews, schedule a meeting with the DSI Team, Daniel, Monika, and relevant stakeholders to review the materials and confirm alignment prior to meeting with the MRMG team.

4. Meet with MRMG Team and Finalize Submission  
- Arrange a meeting with the MRMG team to present your model and documentation. Gather their feedback, make any necessary revisions, and finalize all documents.
- Close out the tracking form and download all finalized files to your local environment.
- Upload the completed documentation to the designated MRMG repository or link provided by the MRMG team.

5. Affirm Model Owner Documentation  
- After documents are uploaded, the MRMG team will send an email to the Model Owner containing the Model Owner Affirmation link.
- The Model Owner must complete the affirmation using the provided documentation link to finalize the process.
