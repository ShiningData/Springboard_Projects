Subject: Next Steps: MRMG Documentation Preparation and Review Process

Dear Team,

As part of our model development workflow, I have downloaded all required MRMG document templates based on our assigned tier and placed them in our designated project folder within the DSI MRMG Documentation directory. You can access the folder directly for the latest templates and materials.

Please review the following documents, which are now available in the project folder:

Model Documentation

Change Log

Outcome Analysis

Operating Manual

Appendix K – Models with Compliance Laws and Regulations
(Note: For Appendix K, please be prepared to coordinate with Meredith B. Andrews regarding Consumer Protection Laws, if applicable.)

Action Items & Process:

Document Preparation:
Begin drafting your assigned sections using the templates provided. If you are unsure which documents pertain to your responsibilities, please confirm with me or consult the C&IB MRMG Points of Contact.

Tracking Progress:
I have also uploaded the MRMG Documents Preparation and Review Tracking Form to the project folder. Please update this form regularly to indicate your progress (Not Started/In Progress/Completed) for each document.

Review and Feedback:
Once you have completed your drafts, upload them to the same folder and update the tracking form. All documents will be subject to peer review and input from Monika, Daniel, and relevant business stakeholders. Please document all feedback and revisions in the tracking form.

Questions and Support:
If you need clarification regarding document content or process steps, do not hesitate to reach out to me directly. For regulatory content in Appendix K, contact details are provided on the form’s first page.

Our goal is to keep this process organized, transparent, and collaborative. Please ensure you are working from the correct templates and keep the tracking form current as we move through preparation and review.

Thank you for your attention and cooperation.
